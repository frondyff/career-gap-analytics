What worked for me was thinking about what I needed a piece of code to do, and then go from there, making sure to test the output, regardless of whether or not I wrote the code using AI or not. 

Think about: can I isolate this piece of logic to a single method? Are there shared attributes I can leverage through classes?

Masters are also situational. You either do them to party longer in college, to escape a bad major, change a career path you’re unhappy with, augment your skill set or because your job/future career path expects it.

If it’s the latter two you should ideally be seeking a masters/mba from a higher regarded college/program and not a degree mill that you pay money for largely zero actual knowledge. 

MIS will have overlap with what you’ve already studied so truly new skills are going to be few. Which begs the question why spend that money and time when you could be making money and growing your professional experience instead.",2

If ""most prod jobs"" are for dashboards that nobody uses, who cares if the data is consistent, interpretable and accurate!",37
1qwrxe8,3,Well databricks “notebook” aren’t literal notebook.,51
1qwrxe8,4,"Whether its a notebook or not isn't really the issue.  The issue is whether there is a proper version control, change control, and rollback process.  Notebooks *usually* don't have that in practice.  But you can do VC, CI/CD, and testing with notebooks.  If you do then there's nothing wrong with using them in prod.


Some more thoughts: The issue that I usually see in practice is that once you start introducing these things then notebooks' convenience is reduced, so there's a lot of resistance against controls that prevent people from just yeeting something into production.  And once you let people yeet their non-important work, its only a matter of time before people start yeeting important work.",10
1qwrxe8,5,"I'll give you an example of how we use synapse notebooks (had no say in technology used, but generally it's enough for our needs) which are orchestrated via pipelines and triggers:

* all processing logic is maintained in a custom python library covered with unit tests and a few integration tests, separate from transform logic
* this custom library has very minor dependencies on Azure (only a few generic functions) and could be migrated to databricks or something similar if necessary
* all notebooks import the library and use same flow, so everything is familiar from notebook to notebook
* simple transformations are mapping based
* more complex transformations are implemented in the notebooks but they can only output a dataframe (later handled by processing module), they can't write to the env directly or depend on some global variables (in some cases wrapper functions can be used to circumvent that)
* changes are committed and deployed using CI/CD
* development and debugging is generally done directly in the notebook but has no effect until it ends up on the main branch and becomes a part of the project
* in most cases when something fails, it's related to env or env specific data and most convenient way is to debug it via notebook which is already part of the isolated workspace and connected storage accounts

1qwn9ak,1,You guys are documenting business logic?,47
1qwn9ak,2,"I'm not a fan of capturing what code is doing in documents. The where clause clearly defines what it is doing. 
I prefer capturing why. 


So very similar to yours but I'd only capture why you're filtering for those countries and category in this model. ",14
1qwn9ak,3,"Depends. I would document the reason why in a comment above. (e.g. decided by manager x to only use x and y). But the code also is a way to capture business logic, so don't go overboard repeating.

 If it's possible I would add a data test (isn't really possible in your example). If you kept the column you could add a dbtutils accepted values for example.",8
1qwn9ak,4,"We do both. We make inline documentation and also we generate documentation for dbt models using LLM. In our case we use Cline or Claude Code. 

We have a specific workflow for each type of model that the LLM follows to generate the docs. 
Moreover, we instruct the LLM to produce the same structure of documentation for each type of model.

For example, curated (mart/gold etc.) models are directed more for the end user and contain sections such as purpose, business use cases, metrics ect. So not too technical. 

Intermediate models ,i.e., models used to split up complex transformation logic are documented with the developers as an audience, so they are much more technical and basically explain what we are doing CTE by CTE.

For most models #Business Logic is a section where we explain the specific business logic/rules implemented. 

The LLM infers these business logic by lopking both at the RAW query and inline comments. Also if it detects a business logic from a query, we instruct it to add short inline comments explaining it. So it goes both ways.

Using LLM to generate documentation increases the doc coverage in our project and increases the uniformity of documentation structure across all models. 

In turn this documentation is then indeed used to power AI Agents for Data Discovery - think chatting with agents to discover which/where data is stored to answer specific request, so they don't answer the question, they just point the user to where they can probably find their answer. It may be also a documented exposure, not model per se. 
And eventually it could also power AI analytics, where they actually access a semantic/metrics layer or directly query the database based on all of the context. 


So yes, we document business logic and use LLMs to do so for uniformity and completeness.",8
1qwn9ak,5,"I err on the side of over-commenting. Any bit of code that would raise the ""why the hell did we do this?"" question by another dev or you in 1-12 months should be commented. 

For the record, we don't have SQL absolutely loaded with comments, just for cases where it's not obvious in the model name why we'd be filtering to ""tech"" for example.",2
1qwn9ak,6,"I think the table description is the best place to document this, the filter is affecting the whole table.

Maybe you can make the filter section a bit easier to scan:

    models:
      - name: gold_top_sales
        description: |
          Monthly sales for top countries and top product category, as defined by business stakeholders (reviewed every 3 years).
    
          **Filter (included rows):**
          - `country` in the defined list of top countries (e.g. US, GB).
          - `category` matches the selected top product category (e.g. tech).

  
Another suggestion would be to avoid hardcoding the countries and the category, but put them into two seeds `top_countries` and `top_category` (these could become just models in future) and reference them in the query, so it's clear that you are picking the top countries and category and from where.",2
1qwn9ak,7,"lol, just join the bandwagon and promise documentation and never deliver. Let's face it. The only person who's going to read it is your replacement, and they're not going to do it because it's going to be out of date.",2

1qwn9ak,9,"So to preface - my team has a documentation setup inside DBT that is dedicated towards feeding the information into an LLM that our BA's utilize to ask questions of instead of us.

1qwd5of,1,"We've been using DuckDB in production for a year now, running and generating the queries we need with Python code.  

So far it's gone great. No major problems.

We switched from developing new pipelines in PySpark to doing so with DuckDB mainly on the basis that:

1. We observed that the actual data loads we were processing were never big enough to necessitate a Spark cluster.
2. Getting rid of Spark meant we could get rid of the whole complexity of running a JVM using the massive collection of libraries Spark requires (with all of their attendant security vulnerabilities) and replace it with a single, dependency-free DuckDB compiled binary.
3. When we tested it against Spark on our real data it ran about 10 times faster and used half the resources (and _yes_, I'm sure the Spark code could have been optimised better, but that's what our testing for our specific use-case showed).

Point 3 was the major one that allowed us to convince ourselves this was a good idea and sell it to management.",105
1qwd5of,2,"It all depends on the size, complexity, and purpose of your stack. In my case, we use DuckDB to detach some queries from Snowflake that even with the smallest compute engine size, would be an overkill, so it's very useful with our processing pipelines. Aside from that, DuckDB is fantastic for Data Analysts, as they can make use of their computers instead of draining resources from the DWH. We also use it in its WASM version as part of the Evidence.dev stack, which nurtures a lot of our dashboards.",24
1qwd5of,3,"Yes, heavily using DuckDB. We work with less data than most companies here I suspect, enough that tables used for analytics can be loaded into instances of our webserver in-memory for extremely quick data analytics on the front end.

So each instance is a Docker image running Django and periodically redownloading the latest DuckDB file (which is an output of our data pipeline elsewhere) and then allowing for views to be constructed via direct access to DuckDB.

I've been thinking about building a proper database driver between Django and DuckDB but for now, a combination of generating direct SQL and using polars have given us everything we need.",11

1qwd5of,6,"We use DuckDB in production. Our dwh is Snowflake and I built a tool that runs worksheets (series of SQL statements) in Snowflake with little templating (Go text/template library). Some workloads started using Snowflake as an engine - in worssheet query from s3 and copy back to s3 immediately.

Then we added support to DuckDB instead, now all processing happens inside the tool, so paying AWS instead of Snowflake.

However, working with big parquets is still better in Snowflake - maybe it’s me, but “select from s3://prefix-with-parquets limit 100” hangs in DuckDB while taking 100ms in Snowflake.",2
1qwd5of,7,"we use it for ad-hoc analytics and local development but not as a primary production db
the sweet spot ive found is:
	∙	running queries against parquet/csv exports without spinning up a full warehouse
	∙	prototyping analytics pipelines before pushing to snowflake
	∙	internal tools where you need fast aggregations but dont need concurrent writes
the limitation is it’s single-process - no concurrent write access, so anything with multiple users writing data simultaneously is a no-go. reads scale fine though
seen some teams embed it in data apps where users query pre-built datasets, works great for that. but if you need a traditional multi-user transactional system it’s not the right tool

Remember, people will optimize for what you measure.  So you better make *really* sure that what you measure is what actually adds value, or what you want people to be focused on.

Doing something around story points is awful, but is one of a small number of equally bad choices.  You can minimize the harm by equalizing story points available across the team, and using discretion to add points (or subtasks) dynamically for things that wind up being more complex than estimated.  It still puts a LOT more pressure (somewhere) on estimating and updating points.  And you will still get people trying to cherry pick tasks with the most ROI (points to level of effort) or pad the points numbers.  Have fun with that!

This is probably a situation where you're guaranteed to end up with someone who is upset.  But at least you can sleep knowing you tried your best to be fair and respectful to your team.  And they should appreciate that you gave them a chance to suggest things that affect their livelihood.

Also, will you be able to try things?  ""Ok, let's try these KPIs for 3 months and see if I agree with them as the manager or whatever"".  Your call if they'd be impersonal enough to present to your team as well.

Measure the product, not the people. Your leadership should care about things like uptime, error rates, and performance/cost improvements.

1qw09c0,10,"The challenge you're running into is real - uniform individual metrics in DE teams almost always create perverse incentives.

Here's what I've seen actually work vs backfire:

What backfires:

•⁠  ⁠Story point velocity becomes a negotiation game immediately

•⁠  ⁠Lines of code or PR counts incentivize wrong behavior

•⁠  ⁠Ticket volume comparisons ignore invisible work (mentoring, architecture thinking, debugging others' pipelines)

What tends to work:

•⁠  ⁠Business context connection: This is the most critical element. How well does the engineer understand the business problem and translate it into data solutions? The best DEs aren't just pipeline builders - they're translators between business needs and technical implementation.

•⁠  ⁠Pipeline health ownership: % of your pipelines with <2% failure rate over rolling 30 days

•⁠  ⁠Data quality resolution: time-to-fix for issues in domains you own

•⁠  ⁠Impact metrics: each engineer proposes 2-3 measurable outcomes at quarter start, manager approves. Gets leadership their ""individual accountability"" while acknowledging that DE work is inherently diverse.

The root issue is often that leadership wanting uniform metrics doesn't trust qualitative judgment. Sometimes the real answer is educating upward on why engineering measurement is different from sales quotas.",1

1qv7786,2,"Did that move about 3 years ago, can share my 2 cents.

Why I switched: I realized the parts of DE I enjoyed most were modeling data for analysts, arguing about metrics definitions, and making dashboards actually useful. I cared less about perfect infra and more about “are people making better decisions with this.” Analytics engineering was basically that full time.

Day to day difference: as a DE I spent a lot of time on infra, pipelines, performance, random firefighting. As an AE I’m still writing SQL and some Python, but I’m way closer to the business. More time on dbt models, tests, documentation, semantic layers, and collaborating with PMs / analysts. Less Kafka / Spark / k8s, more “what does ‘active user’ actually mean and can we stop changing it every quarter.”

Step up or step down: it’s more of a fork than a ladder. If you like infra and scale problems, AE will feel softer. If you like modeling, metrics, and being involved in product / strategy chats, it feels like a step up because your impact is easier to see. Comp for me stayed roughly the same, slightly higher later because I became the “metrics owner” and that’s valuable at product‑led companies.

Branding / career path: I brand myself as “data platform + analytics” now. Titles I see after AE: senior AE, analytics lead, data product manager, head of data, sometimes even PM for data products. You become a good candidate for roles where you’re the bridge between pure engineering and pure analytics.

Gotchas:
You will write a lot of SQL and stakeholder‑friendly docs.
You’ll spend more time in meetings explaining data than tuning clusters.
If you hate ambiguity and politics around definitions, it can be frustrating.

With 8 years as DE you’re probably overqualified on the tech side. The real question is whether you want to move closer to the business and be judged more on clarity, communication and “does this metric make sense” than on how elegant your pipeline is. If yes, AE is a pretty solid move.",65

I still do many DE tasks, but not nearly as many as before. Because I can do both, when I need data from a new source, alot of the time ill write the process and send it to the DEs to deploy. 

I work with a DE only people and ive noticed a here a huge difference in design patterns. Their solutions tend to be one off purpose built imports. They almost never parameterize their solutions and any meta data used is typically a json file in the app and locked behind version control.

When you are tasked with modeling an enterprise asset, you're forced to figure out ways of genericize your solution to support future initiatives. Alot of times this means data driven solutions for DE tasks... and I dont see many DE only peers that use data to drive their pipelines.

However, we do bring in parquet files that get generated from a stream which gets way more new columns. The way I currently handle that is I check schema and if a new column shows up I alert for it and ignore it in the process so it can at least continue and do the job as the new field is rarely needed immediately for reporting.

i have seen setups stay very stable by keeping duckdb local or in a small service, parquet in object storage, and being very disciplined about ingestion and freshness checks. grafana does not really care where the sql engine lives as long as it is predictable.

the big thing i would think about is ops overhead. once you leave a managed service, you are signing up to own upgrades, disk issues, and weird edge cases. that can still be worth it at 100 giB, but only if you are honest about how much time you want to spend babysitting it.

This is actually a bad thing.  I like MySQL for other reasons, but I can't think of any circumstance where it is better to leave off the aggregate function (this also goes for ANY_VALUE in Snowflake, ugh). Newer versions of MySQL warn you for doing this and maybe it's even a default error by now, if you don't set a legacy flag in SQL_MODE.

What happens is that you get an arbitrary value from that column, instead of something deterministic (as defined by what aggregate function you choose).

Most of their business is in government contracts.  That’s bad from the standpoint that the business would almost certainly fold if they lost those contracts or a large portion of them.  It’s far better if a consulting firm has clients spread across several business sectors.  If you have your business spread roughly evenly across five sectors and there is a downturn in one, two or even three sectors, you could survive as a business.  On the other hand, the federal government is frequently good for business.

Honestly, the IRS cut 31 contracts with Booz Allen less than a week ago.  It was over the leaking of IRS wealthy taxpayer data by a Booz Allen employee.  They still have quite a few contracts, most with the DOD.

I don't rush to deliver every single project and fall for their manufactured urgency

1qtwdcf,4,"Established insurance companies usually rock. They're incredibly risk-averse by nature, so there are tons of lifers here.

I'm a mid-level/senior-ish DE at a F500 insurer these days, after I spent time in higher education, B4 consulting, and then built the data team at a PE-backed startup in the healthcare sector. I've done the stress of consulting and PE, and I can't imagine leaving insurance these days unless it was to go back to higher ed, but the pay there doesn't compete with the pay in insurance.

Insurance in general tends to have a lot of lifers, my team these days has 14 folks, with an average age of 51. Five of us are younger than 40, seven folks are older than 50, and one gentleman still plugging away at 73. Only two of us have been here less than 8 years, and six have been here 15+ years.

I was at USAA for about a year before this, and they also had a ton of long-timers. My team there was \~8 folks and only two of us had been there less than a decade, lots of folks had started in other jobs at the company and then cross-trained over into DE as the company built their org. They want to keep folks who really get the insurance business, that domain knowledge is really helpful.

Not sure if I'd recommend USAA right now, though. They're going through a whole lot of flux these last few years, and I think I'd steer clear until they figure things out, maybe 2028\~2030 or so. The thing that hurt USAA was that they got out over their skis after their big hiring burst during Covid, so they tried to thin the workforce with a ton of early retirement incentives in 2023, and then still had to do their first-ever wave of layoffs in 2024. Morale went from sky-high to the absolute gutter after the layoffs, so a lot of us bounced in the aftermath of that.

In my experience, these companies often pay above average and offer a lot of learning opportunities. Since there is always so much that needs to be done, I can often pick and choose what I want to work on.

1qtfbhx,2,"What is the end goal here? Are you trying to visualize those aggregated performance numbers in a web page, power a BI dashboard, generate a static report, or just run raw queries? The end goal is important. 

The first thing I would do is trash your lambda fetch. Even a hot-start lambda is going to be slower than a dedicated API layer running in something like ECS. Further, you need to refine your data layer to include a layer optimized for data fetches for your specific needs. Something that could be useful would be building an OLAP layer, with is (more or less) just a vectorized representation of your data for rapid dynamic aggregation. Something like the [elasticube](https://pypi.org/project/elasticube/) library. That might be too much for your specific needs, though, so wait until you add that.

In summary:
- Get rid of the Lambda fetch in favor of a dedicated API layer that automatically handles authentication
- Evaluate your database for an analytical layer to support data fetches (add indexes, split into dim/fact, optimize tables/partitions for the most common queries)
- Look into OLAP cubes for better performance if query lag time is still an issue",1

1qtdnvi,2,"Generally you build a Kimball-style dimensional model for long-term analytics. Semantic models are generally for self-service. Operational analytics (that is, real time decision-making) is generally where modeling is not quite as strong. You’re still going to make a model, but integrating them across systems is harder.

There are also operational data engineering tasks that don’t care at all about models. E.g., get some data from a database and upload to some API every night.",11

1qtdnvi,4,"For anything reasonable analytic related- especially for scale you need a well thought through data model. 

However for operational data processing or perhaps even operational analytics you often can relax modeling and governance requirements as the data is not repurposed for varied analytical consumption- rather single use for a well defined operational process",3
1qtdnvi,5,"A dimensional model is a means to an end, and generally speaking, the end is that consumers need an organized and optimal way to gain insights into the data that's being collected. 

Simply put, if the data is already organized, accessible, and every business question can be easily answered, then there is no need for a dimensional model. 

As an example, I have worked for a few SaaS companies where the data collected was never viewed across clients and client insights only required a semantic layer for self service analytics. There is no need for a dimensional model because using an OBT model in a medallion architecture (or whatever you choose to call it) can do the job required with limited development.",4

I think when there is a very specific (narrow) purpose in the ""consumption"" layer - dimensional model might not always justified.

When I model, I ask myself and stakeholder two questions:  
1. how data will be queried  
2. how data will be updated (=>complexity, cost, resilience)

1qtc0ag,3,Sounds sensible. You could always change to what I call a partition swap (no idea if it has a proper name). The year or a primary key becomes the partition key. For every year found in the file loaded these will be swapped/replaced in your staging table.

FP&A in my experience is awful because you get a bunch of excel jockeys who think that because they can maintain a rats nest of insane excel macros and formulas that they know how to “do data engineering”. 

I’m obviously generalizing, but in working in data for almost 10 years, this has been my experience working with several marketing/Finance teams across several companies",6
1qscp60,4,"I love working with marketing teams because the numbers don’t matter just the velocity and the direction. Vibes rule. 

Finance and Supply Chain on the other hand can go and do one.",2
1qscp60,5,"In my experience marketing requires a loooot of communication and clearly set rules before working together. 

It's easy to say they're always blaming others but let's be real, without them the company would earn way less and you wouldn't have a job there. So let's make their work as easy as possible.

\- EVERYONE in their team should be aware of your current data infrastructure + its limitations. They should know your roadmap/sprint board/whatever, so they don't think you're sitting on your asses and do nothing.  
\- If they have recurring issues, create a ticket, let them follow it. Whenever they try to blame, ask them to tell their lead to discuss with your data lead to prioritize it. If your lead declines, they won't annoy you because they know why they don't get it.  
\- Block urgent ad-hoc requests. Every request has to be a ticket with a clear description + impact + what happens if they don't have it within the next <time period>. With the last question a lot of urgent things will not be urgent anymore. Most of the time it's just a blocker they want to get rid off asap.   
\- Sometimes they actually don't have the data to do their jobs. Can you provide an interim solution by pulling raw data without implementing it into your data model? So they can run simple queries.

Know your people, try to be seen as an overworked ally who wants to unblock them. Data Engineering in business teams is one of the most stakeholder-management intense jobs. The better you get in that, the less stressful your job will be",1
1qscp60,6,"They’ve been the worst at math, in my experience. Say the cost was $3000 and we acquired 23 customers, not one would know how to work out the cost per customer. It was a lot of vibes. A new person would come in and contradict the strategy of their predecessor. ",1
1qscp60,7,"I work in Marketing Operations, and I find the challenges I deal with day-to-day are underestimated by management.

1. I often find that I don’t have the data to do what is being asked of me. Most commonly, this happens when there is a campaign where the target audience is brand new. I cannot tell you how many times I find myself caught in email chains with compliance and legal where their segmentation criteria requirements specify data points that the company does not even have and has no way of obtaining in a timely or reasonable way. Many times, I will point this out to my superiors who will just ignore me and leave me to figure it out on my own because they have no idea what to do. This literally happened to me last quarter. 🤪 

I work closely with the team that does operational comms, and it is similarly stressful because they do not always know what list criteria they will need or when. They often deal with Sudoku like puzzles where they have to build lists with pieces of information, from multiple applications and then find a method to validate the results.

Even coordinating sends becomes challenging because of how dynamic the production process is. Multiple rounds of revisions means delayed approval which can push past the expected send date, causing sending conflicts that now have to be sorted out with multiple teams that often believe their message should be priority.

2. Yes. “Everything is a fire.” 🔥 Things break unexpectedly all the time, and we are constantly conducting an orchestra in front of a live audience. Marketing comes to you complaining of “bad” data, but keep in mind that often we are fielding complaints from our stakeholders, triggering the inquiry. (FWIW Typically, I only flag anomalies after multiple observations or complaints. I also do some initial investigating on my end, like reviewing audit and sync error logs to rule out the obvious.)

Successfully capturing UTM parameters is kind of like walking a tightrope if you have a bloated tech stack and duplicate records. Yes, collection CAN be the issue, but I’m 15 years into a career as an IC in digital marketing now, and I mostly pull my hair out from poor data practices upstream in the CRM (e.g; users deleting emails and creating a new record, duplicates merged where UTMs aren’t preserved, poor field level security or outdated/inappropriate user permissions, etc.) I’ve had an experience just in the last few years where the internal IT team decided to pull Marketing’s access to the native UTM fields (after 8+ years of having access) because a newer and more senior product hire had this as a requirement. It broke all of the UTM tracking from the website and some other applications, and I had to spend a year arguing with them to get it fixed 🙄

The practices I see in Salesforce in the last 5 years truly feel like a major regression from the ways that I learned to manage data and technology early on in my career. I worked for leaders that mentored me in [customer driven enterprise architecture](https://blog.opengroup.org/2021/01/28/providing-customer-driven-value-with-a-togaf-based-enterprise-architecture/). It feels like it’s become a foreign concept with what I see now. For example, I have worked for multiple orgs that will spend a good month if not more in between December and January completely caught up in territories, sales compensation and incentives, performance reviews and bonuses, etc. Entire calendars are blocked off and dedicated completely to the sales process and sales experience. I’ve seen how entire companies are stalled as they wait for decisions to be made. 

Lastly, sometimes we work for people that will use their authority to put pressure on us or our managers to force us to do things we know are stupid. 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️ It’s riskier to say this if you work remotely, but when I worked in person, it’s the kind of thing I absolutely would’ve acknowledged in a whisper 🤫",1
1qscp60,8,"Let me tell you my experience working for an ISP.

I have a degree in Telecommunications and decided to go for a Master in Big Data. I always liked the field, a lot of people in engineering like to code, or make autocad prints, or maybe do a CCNA.But a a few people understand that understanding KPI or statistics to solve a problem. Even my more 'telecom' job was being a RF engineer for a Vendor, a position that I feel that was more data focused than other things.

Now, I ended getting this job after being lay off from my last job as a presales, and they put me directly in Sales Department, my coordinator was a long time Marketing people (he is algo an engineer, but always have been in sales or marketing); and this means that I began to panick. To think that my path from this point is being in sales (That I highly hate), but at the end I understand that i am not being less technical, my position is still Data Specialist; my job is still do some stuff in python and PowerBI, and at the end I understand that Marketing is the department that appreciate you ETL to get the stuff they needs to sell. Of course, I always have in mind my projects of Net Automation that I sometimes can mention to the NOC, but this does not means that I am not doing what I like. Also Marketing is less stuborn with the way you do your things that the all tome NOC Specialist or IT Guys, that thinks they way of doing things is the only good way, so...",1
1qscp60,9,"Damn , are you me? I work closely with marketing and finance team. 

The thing with marketing team is they work on hunch rather than using the data. 

Their requirements are vague. They want to do A/B testing and when I suggested groups they were like no this is not what we want. 

They sometimes forget their own KPI doesn’t have complete understanding of how the ERP system works and how to leverage sales and do marketing based on it. 

Overall if they dint know what they are doing. Our life can be hell.

Also they sometimes ask very basic questions which pisses  me off",1
1qsccxn,1,"What do you mean display it? If you're trying to like, print it out in the terminal, and it's way too big, it might just be the actually printing it part that is taking forever.

If you're trying  .collect on 100GB if data that's a lot to download over wifi and certainly bigger than your computer's memory.

My first thought is create a sandbox environment for testing and just dont expose it in a way that would risk breach. That seems like the most straightforward.

If you NEED to share with others, I would make sure all PII is in dim tables so your core dataset only has ids where things like email or name might be (better system design anyway). If you have secondary dims like company association/email domain, then make sure data is extracted to another dim table. Then you could just perform analysis using unique keys rather than pii fields and then arbitrarily assign labels to the ids like companyA, participant01798, country12, regionB or whatever the pii granularity you need to analyze but not display might be.

If you are talking about actually exposing the dataset to parties that are a pii leak risk... then the dim approach would help with cogently mapping people/companies/addresses to nonidentifiable labels that maintain full data integrity and the relationships between samples.",2

We send out 10k applications monthly for our clients and we analyzed which have highest chances of jobs 

LinkedIn was the worst. Most were expired 

My guess, LI was recycling jobs for SEO",2
1qs44qq,2,"Couple things from someone who was in a very similar “I like cloud + data but entry level feels impossible” spot:

First, your background is actually a plus. Biomedical + CS + interest in AWS is a really solid combo for any company doing healthcare / medtech / clinical analytics. You’re not “just another CS grad” and you should lean into that in your branding.

Job search stuff:

You’re not going to win by only applying through LinkedIn / Indeed. Use them to find roles, but assume most of your “wins” will come from:
- Direct company career pages (especially mid‑sized boring‑sounding companies, not just the big names)
- Alumni network from your undergrad and your MS program
- Local meetups / online meetups (data engineering, cloud, healthcare analytics)

On LinkedIn specifically:
Search for “data engineer”, filter by Experience → Entry level / Associate, and also try “analytics engineer” and “data analyst” with SQL + Python + cloud. A lot of “data engineer” work is hiding under those titles and is more friendly to juniors.

Then for roles you like:
Check who works there as a data engineer / analytics engineer / dev on LinkedIn. Add them with a short note like:
“Hey, saw you work on X at Y. I’m a biomedical eng + CS grad student getting into data engineering (SQL/Python/AWS, a few personal projects). Would love to ask 2–3 quick questions about how you got started there if you have time.”
You’re not asking for a job, you’re asking for info. Some % of those chats naturally turn into referrals.

Targeting-wise, with your background I’d look at:
Health tech startups, EHR vendors, medical device companies, hospital systems, insurers, pharma / biotech. They all have messy data and love someone who actually understands the domain.

Also, consider “bridge” roles:
Data analyst, BI dev, “reporting engineer,” even some backend roles with a data flavor. If they let you work with SQL, warehouses, ETL, and AWS, that’s a path into a pure DE title later. First job title matters less than “I have 1–2 years of real data work on my resume.”

Projects:
Make 2–3 small but real projects that scream “I can do data engineering” and “I know healthcare”.
Example: pull some public health dataset, build a basic pipeline:
ingest → clean → store → query → simple dashboard.
Put it on GitHub, write a 1‑page README that explains the problem, tech stack, and what you did. This is gold in interviews.

If you want to play with realistic internal‑tool type stuff: spin up a small web UI on top of that data so someone non‑technical could view / edit it. Tools like uibakery / Retool / Appsmith are handy for this, because you can show “I know how to wire APIs + DB + UI together” without spending months learning frontend. That’s closer to what a lot of internal data teams actually do.

Mindset part:
The “no light at the end of the tunnel” feeling is super normal. Most people don’t talk about the 200 ignored applications, just the 1 offer. If you’re sending out apps into a void with no feedback, shift some of that time into:
- Reaching out to humans
- Tightening 1–2 standout projects
- Practicing SQL + basic data modeling + simple dbt / Airflow patterns so you crush technical screens

You’re not incapable. The market is just noisy and bad at surfacing juniors. Your combo of domain + CS + cloud interest is good. If you keep iterating on outreach + projects and stay flexible on titles, you’ll get a crack at it.",1
1qs44qq,3,"I also completed a Bachelor's in Biomedical Engineering before I pivoted to data engineering, so feel free to ask questions. Personally, I got my first junior role by applying to an opening on LinkedIn so nothing special on that part. But I can offer insight on what is expected as a junior, and what I did to land the role. First thing's first, you need a decent understanding of Python and SQL, these are your core languages for almost everything. Next, learn the basics of how to handle data, build pipelines, understand the basics of cloud in terms of DE.

1qs3tbl,6,"My first DE job was just grabbing csvs and excel sheets and ingesting them. Then they wanted reports to be made on them and didn't have anyone available so did that (Data analyst stuff) Then they needed more and to encorporate that (Back to DE). Its less about job title at a certain point if you find the ebb and flow and can learn tools to do what the business needs. I did that for 2 years before I considered my self good enough to be called a professional and not a junior. Maybe you move faster than that. Also Migrating from an old system to a new system is a part of the cycle. Snowflake and Fabric are current generation cloud tech, so you are getting a free education on how to use them, take advantage of it!

Ask yourself, How would you build this whole system? What does the whole system look like? Data engineering isn't just ETL, its a big part of it but the data modeling and being able to serve the overall system is the important part. Do you understand the whole system?

Timeline to understand when to move is kind of irrelavent. Actually understanding and being able to apply those skills is when you make a move. You don't just set that to arbitrary 6/12/24 month timelines. When you gain the capability and understanding thats when you can think about moving to the next thing. There is always a next thing.

  
Back when I started there was only MSQL 2000 and Crystal reports or SSRS. Now there are 50 different technologies to do the same with python , Java, or C#. So tools have gotten more sophisticated. Pick a path, learn that path, maybe use claude code/Code assistant of choice to help you build one, then read and understand how its built. Look up tutorials from youtube and compare that to your solution. Read the libraries and documentation that make it work. Then go from there. 

Build a whole program that takes in data to do something useful. Kaggle has a bunch of examples for this.

1qrzk69,1,"We have been using Airbyte OSS for the last year and have had issues from the beginning. Primarily, it doesn’t scale well. We originally used abctl on a VM and that maxed out with a few db to db cdc connections. Now using it on k8 with a dedicated Postgres db and blob storage for logs. Performance is better but not much. 

It’s honestly been a very janky product. Random bugs, successful runs that silently failed, sporadic OOM errors when there is 64gb of memory available, and the list goes on. Shoot we are on azure and abctl would randomly crap out because of a missing AWS env var. It also didn’t integrate well with the rest of our open source stack - dagster, dbt, open metadata

The real tradeoff is connector breadth vs operational stability. Airbyte has lots of connectors but many are uneven quality and you own the blast radius when APIs change.

It allows for much more flexible analysis over the longer term and produces much more predictable results.

Especially when the front end tool is something like Power BI. DAX will turn into an absolute nightmare with flat models. 

If I had a developer on my team just connecting flat tables to Power BI, they’d be coached once or twice, and if they kept doing it they’d be fired. 

It’s just sloppy, bad practice from either citizen developers or backend developers who either don’t know how data is used on the front end, or who don’t understand architecture and are happy to spend all their time writing new views every time a user wants to see things at a different level of detail. 

It’s not “spending more time driving value for the business” vs “spending time battling tech”.

It’s putting actual thought into your design to your solution can be scalable and flexible to maintain rather than brute forcing a solution that requires you to build another standalone view every time someone needs a new report.

1qrlhoj,9,"​20+ years in data/ETL here. Beyond just practicing SQL syntax, focus on these data engineering-specific concepts for Shopify:

1.​Performance thinking: When you write queries during the assessment, always consider ""how would this perform on millions of rows?"" Shopify deals with massive scale. Use EXPLAIN plans, avoid SELECT *, and think about index usage.

2. ​Data quality patterns: Practice SQL for data validation, deduplication (ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION BY), and identifying data anomalies. Real data engineering involves catching bad data before it breaks pipelines.

3. ​Incremental processing: Since you mentioned building pipelines mostly in Python, practice SQL patterns for incremental loads—using timestamps, watermarks, and merge/upsert logic. Think ""how do I process only new/changed data efficiently?""

4.​Set-based thinking: Coming from Python, you might be used to loops. SQL is set-based. Practice writing queries that transform entire datasets at once rather than row-by-row logic.

5. ​Real-world scenarios: Go beyond LeetCode. Practice queries like:
  ​Detecting duplicate orders
  ​Calculating running totals/moving averages
  ​Handling NULL values and edge cases
  ​Transforming nested/JSON data

​For Shopify specifically: They care about how you communicate your approach. Talk through your thinking: ""I’m using a CTE here for readability"" or ""This JOIN might be slow, but we could index X…""

1qr1ah1,1,">What's the motivation to still pursue this field ?

As somebody who went into this field from a different field, if you work in IT/programming, don't suck at it, and work for a decent company, GOOD LORD is it a sweet deal.

Life as a chemist:

* There is no such thing as remote work.  You are on-site 100% of the time.  I used to have to commute 1.5 hours one way if it was a quick journey.  Made me give up all of my hobbies post work.  Standard working day was around 12 hours (wake up at 6, get home at around 6).  Yeah, I could have moved closer but I'm glad I didn't because it meant I'd have moved to bum fuck nowhere for a job which ended my contract during the pandemic
* Labs are often in shitty locations.  Good luck if you want to live near a city and have a reasonable commute time.  Didn't pack a lunch? Budget 20 minutes of your lunch time getting to and from somewhere to get something to eat
* People think lab work is a refined art where people stand around in pristine labs and discuss how the universe works.  In reality, the labs are freezing cold in winter, swelteringly hot in summer, and poorly maintained.  Half of me isn't surprised because if there is an explosion/fire, it's not a huge amount of damage cost.
* No windows can be quite common in buildings.  Somewhere I used to work, during winter there were days I'd see no natural light (get in before sun rise, sun sets at around 4 pm)
* It's also a lot more physical than people give credit for.  Lifting large/heavy vessels into/out of your fume cupboard as well as transporting large quantities of materials isn't easy on your back as you get older
* I worked in organic synthesis where if you don't have a PhD in chemistry, it's incredibly hard to not only break into the field but succeed because you're talking about the vast majority of people have a PhD, thus use it as a stick to beat you with (quite fairly, tbh).  I do not have a PhD and was usually the only person in the lab who didn't have a PhD
* The work environment is a lot less forgiving than tech.  You can't google and hit the right answer easily.  You really have to know what you are asking the internet.  Even then, the answers are likely not widely published.  People are a lot smarter on average and a lot less willing to accept bullshit answers
* Salaries are not remotely comparable although you do get a much better pension.  For reference, I used the chemical companies used to pretty much double your contributions.  I have never seen that figure in IT

Life as a DE:

* Work from home is an option.  If you have to turn up, at least your office is likely somewhere accessible and temperature controlled
* A much lower barrier to entry.  The idea you ""need"" a Masters degree is, in my opinion, complete bollocks.  DE education requirements are not standardised across the industry whereas chemistry absolutely is.  It's not possible to get into chemistry without a chemistry degree, although you can definitely get into data without a CS degree
* Difficulty isn't anywhere near as close.  If I ruin a reaction in the lab, good luck getting that shit back.  I guess it's like dropping a DB without a back up, although it's much easier to back something up than it is to make an extra X amount of material in case, I don't know, you drop your flask on the floor, somebody knocks it over etc.  You live in a world of glass so breakages are inevitable
* General working is a lot easier.  Synthesis of a product can take a long time.  A long one is multiple days if not weeks.  You can turn something around quickly and have almost unlimited tries at it in DE
* Stakes being lower means it's not as stressful although it does mean you get a lot more bozos because people are less careful.  The introduction of AI has massively exposed who is and isn't a fraud (anybody who struggles without AI or ""has to"" lie on their CV is absolutely a fraud)
* Zero manual labour.  Much much lower chances of dying - I used to make novel pharmaceutical compounds which were definitely biologically active although since it has never been made or tested before (publicly), nobody has any idea how toxic the compound is.  So, it could either do nothing or murder you on the spot.  Fun fact: I once made something which was over 30 times more potent than fentanyl
* Salaries are way higher on average.  After 2-3 years of being in DE, I earnt double what I did as my final salary as a chemist after around 10 years in the industry

So what I'm saying is life is relative.  If you have only ever worked in tech, then yeah, the grass will always seem greener.  As somebody coming in from the other way in, it's definitely greener within the IT industry.",46
1qr1ah1,2,"Ehhh. I mean, imo there's always going to be stuff ai can't do, at least without an informed human nudging it in the right direction and keeping an eye on the outputs at some point?

If you enjoy the work and you're good at figuring new stuff out I'd say there's no need to jump ship to full-time goose husbandry just yet, trust yourself and your abilities and keep following your nose about what's useful/interesting to learn and work on. Yeah a lot of the straightforward stuff can be handled by an agentic approach, but in my experience there's always going to be weird new stuff cropping up and that often needs a meat-based neural net aka a human to figure out 😜",15

I get that it's a huge paradigm shift, and a lot of our careers are in danger at the moment. But (imo) AI is proving to be the ultimate floor-raiser so we as engineers are only shooting ourselves in the foot by not trying to integrate it as best as possible into our toolkit.

1qqvw49,3,"You are on a right path and well aware, the market is brutal. We've had a long hiring phase and let me tell you what I've seen from interviewing:

\- Most larger companies get \~1000 CVs in a day. Most of them are trash tbf, but recrutiers won't take much time to scan your resume. Make sure it's easy to read. Make sure there is impressive stuff in there. Look at your CV and compare yourself with 1000 random people. Is there any way you can change something to make it better than your competitors?

\- THEN work on the technical details. You'll most likely have some of these 3 interviews: SQL/Python, Data Modeling, Data Architecture/System Design. If it's not a startup they'll most likely ask you concepts and not directly questions related to a platform like AWS. So understand frameworks: Orchestration, Deployment, Quality Testing, Monitoring etc. You can learn those directly with Airflow, dbt etc. or even build it by yourself in Python. Cool project to show btw.

\- At any seniority, people suck at SQL. At least for an Analytics Engineering role, this should be your best mastered skill. JOINs, GROUP BYs, Aggregations are the most basic skills. People failed so frequently on rolling averages, knowing when to use a window function and when not, how to filter by year or month, not knowing anything about how queries execute etc. I still can't believe I've rejected \~70% in a simple SQL round. Here's your first spot to shine.

\- Be a cool person. If we had a laugh and I'm between reject and pass, you'll likely pass.

\- For Data Architecture questions, learn tradeoffs: Correctness vs Latency, Storage vs Compute, Reliability vs Velocity, Efficiency vs Capabilities, Cap Theorem etc. When to use what + example use cases.

\- For Data Modeling its the same answer: Ingestion Layer (Event Logs, Snapshots) -> Facts (out of events)/Dimensions (out of snapshots) -> Aggregations/Data Marts -> KPIs. Understand what happens in every step. This is a usual dbt workflow, learn it by just moving some messy tables to create a final cool KPI.

\- If you want to add a personal project: Have a URL, let me click it and let me be able to explore it and think ""cool"". I won't ever use your project. But having something I could use already would make you stand out by a lot because you prooved you can deploy stuff.",3

1qqoayv,1,"> I’d like to strengthen my long-term position, fill in some theory gaps, and - now that I have a young family - set a good example by continuing my education.

The questions to ask are two-fold here:

* What do you think you'd learn from doing a degree?
* Is this a balanced professional-personal decision?

I see this a lot with ""already working but considering further education"" posts - there is having a degree for tangible benefits (if you imagine it's very difficult to be a doctor or lawyer without an actual degree) and there is having a degree for personal reasons (some people want a degree simply to have a degree).  

Nothing wrong with the latter, although it's one of those where if you're in a position to obtain a degree with little to no consequence to yourself (I'd say this describes option 2 accurately), and don't mind sticking the time in, then by all means go ahead.

Conversely, if you're already working, and have been working, then additional education, unless you have been told with absolute certainty that's what's holding you back, doesn't hold much value.  You'd learn infinitely more on the job, anything you don't know you can probably teach yourself, all the while you have the flexibility of being paid and choosing when you study - something I can imagine is a lot more valuable when you have a young family rather than being locked 3-6 years into a degree you feel obligated to finish.

Between the two choices, option 2 to get it over and done with although would say none of those options are really worth the time investment and you'd get a better return spending time with your family and pursuing your hobbies.",1

That said with 13 years under your belt you would likely be very under challenged.  

Personally I’d see if you could get on a Masters course of some way (possibly with a conversion). 

Also: I’ve seen some senior people go for apprenticeship and … it’s a doss, way of doing less at work and taking advantage of the system. Put it this way, I’ve not seen many/any top quality people putting themselves for DA’s - even ones without university educations.",1

1qqhdks,3,"I have seen metadata-driven ingestion work well, but only when people are honest about what it is good at and what it is not. In my current setup (airflow + spark sql) we built a framework for the boring 80% of ingestion. Basically ever source gets a config file that defines things like:

* source location and fromat
* expected schema and key fields
* load mode (append vs merge)
* basic column-level transforamtions
* partitioning and retention rules
* data quality checks such as nulls, uniqueness, etc

Airflow just reads the metadata and generates the DAG tasks dynamically so adding a new table is as good as adding a new config and redeploy. That works actually, better than what I was expecting.

Where these frameworks usually die is when people try to stretch them into solving the hard 20% - business logic, weird timestamps, broken upstream APIs, one-off edge cases,. At that point you are building a DSL inside YAML, and nobody wants to debug YAML on friday.

The happy middle ground is metadtaa drives ingestion and standard bronze/silver handling. Anythign complex gets real python module with tests. Configs stay declarative so cannot do programming in configs (which is good).

It has been a really long time since doing ""a course"" is enough to get a job.  Courses are an introduction to a topic.  Not a complete solution.  You do not do a course and become a complete programmer in the same way graduating with a medicine degree makes you ready to carry out complex, life threatening surgery.

A common misconception is that all you need is a course.  Personally, I did an online courses.  I did a few actually.  6-8 months later, I got my first DE role with no experience whatsoever.  Without any further detail, this makes getting into DE sound really fucking easy.

What isn't included is all of the work outside of those courses.  I was literally writing code, watching videos, reading blogs, writing stuff down, and generally thinking about programming for 60-70 hours per week every week for around 6 months.  And when I say writing code, I wasn't following tutorials.  I was googling the fuck out of the internet on how to try and do what I wanted to do.  As you can tell, that's a lot more than 70-90 hours.

On top of that, what's also not mentioned is my career before being in DE involved interpreting data on pretty much a daily basis.  Sometimes, stuff which you can't even measure, test, or see.  This makes working with data which travels between two places quite straightforward relative to somebody who hasn't had the same background as me.

>I need to know so I know if I'm simply wasting my time. If they are nice additions that reflect skill, but at the end of the day, not enough on their own, and businesses really want a college degree.

I'd be lying if I said a university degree doesn't make your life easier.  Of course it does.

That being said, you are only wasting your time if you think the course is ""enough"".  There are lot of soft skills which you can't really measure and they are a lot more valuable than the degree itself.  You have the massive benefit of not being time gated with what and how you learn which is balanced against not having a traditional degree.

1qq9o22,2,"An RDBMS stores data, Spark jobs process data - they are not the same type of thing",39
1qq9o22,3,"focus on the ideas for now. e.g you have tools to handle massive data and tools to handle smaller sized data. 

Having experience in both is important on the long run, simply because small data can sometimes have tons of insights, and massive data can be filled with noise.

and most importantly in data engineering, never underestimate how many people think that they need massive data tools when they have small data and VICE VERSA... e.g companies with massive data trying to fit it all in pandas with 8gb of ram",14
1qq9o22,4,"Most small-medium sized companies, and large companies with low data maturity don’t need spark or distributed processing. But once you start getting into TB/PB territory it becomes critical. A lot of it is industry dependent. My current company is advertising tech and it’s critical because we process hundreds of millions of events per day. Compare that to when I used to work at a regional bank and the biggest table we had was like 30M records, so we could do all processing in SQL server itself.",13
1qq9o22,5,"It basically comes down to OLTP vs OLAP needs

RDBMS are optimized for OLTP, which is coherence, precise small scope fast fetching, small precise fast joining and processing, but they also do an excelllent job at small sized OLAP workflows.

OLAP systems are optimized for large fetches, large joins, large processing etc, and do not require as much speed for small fetches, they don't usually involve thousands of concurrent edits so coherence is less complex and less costly to maintain, and most importantly, they scale well with size, they usually* use cold storage and distributed processing.",10
1qq9o22,6,"Think of data stores being in 3 separate categories:

1. Traditional SQL databases (RDBMS) - MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, etc.
2. NoSQL - MongoDB, DynamoDB, Neo4J, etc.
3. Warehouses and data lakes - Azure ADLS, Amazon S3, Redshift, etc.

They all store data, but for different purposes. RDBMS systems are used for storing application data that gets read and updated by users all the time (think of user profiles, posts, comments to posts, orders, etc.), and these store data in relational row-based form under the hood, and have their own internal mechanisms for data processing related to application business logic, constraint and transaction enforcement (OLTP for application data).

NoSQL systems also store application business data, they're preferred in the use cases where RDBMS' strict constraint, transaction, schema enforcement and strong consistency become a bottleneck - mainly, data partitioning. It's a big and complex topic to explain in one sentence, but generally speaking, NoSQL systems sacrifice those perks to some degree to achieve native and easy horizontal scalability across multiple servers in a cluster (don't confuse with read replicas), which is a tradeoff that's OK for many modern use cases.

Warehouses and data lakes is where that application data later lands to from the main database(s), for the purposes of analytical workloads, BI, AI/ML (OLAP workloads). The reason data is placed in a different place for these workloads is because it needs to be organized differently under the hood to be efficiently queried for these purposes (keywords to look up - columnar data format, parquet, OLAP) - while application database needs to be fast for lots of small individual writes and reads per row, warehouses need to be very fast at batch querying, big scans and throughput. And Spark is a data processing tool, that does distributed processing for warehouses and data lakes, not for OLTP workloads. Also to keep in mind, if your data is not that big and you can process it on one server without any problem, you don't need Spark, a custom Python script using e.g. Pandas dataframes for transformations will do the job without the overhead of setting up a cluster.",4
1qq9o22,7,"I want to add to what others have said, one thing that your standard OLTP monolith needs is more management. You have to worry about indexing and fragmentation, amongst other things, that require upkeep. The analytical databases usually don't need that, so you generally pay more for them but you also don't need DBAs to manage them. Spark is overkill for the majority of people who use it, but spark allows software devs to not sit in SQL all day, if they don't want to.",3

1qq4aw3,2,"Hi, a few things to consider.

\- Data Talks Zoom Camp uses GCP, whereas Data Engineering by Joe Reis uses AWS. Even though the cloud technology you use doesn't matter much to learn the concepts, it's still better to start with what you are interested in.  
\- Zoom Camp is semi-structured and felt all over the place with some GitHub content, YouTube videos, past Cohort links, etc. For someone like me, it's very easy to deviate and lose interest.  
\- Joe Reis's course is well structured with a lot of optional material and paired with the Fundamentals of Data Engineering as the course's textbook. The assignments follow a similar structure to other Andrew NG's courses. Not too tough to pass. But, still a lot to explore and learn.  
\- ZoomCamp is free but uses a sponsored orchestrator. The deeplearning course uses Airflow, which is considered standard. Of course, there is Dagster and a few other tools gaining traction. So, this is not too significant either.  
\- ZoomCamp is tweaked and updated every year. But the DeepLearning course stays the same. But since it's a very recent release, it still covers the most popular tools and concepts, such as Lakehouse architecture, dbt, text data processing for AIML workloads, etc.  
\- ZoomCamp has a strict deadline to get the certificate. You will still achieve it if you start now. I assume the score weightage is mostly on the capstone project. For the Deep Learning one, you can keep paying and extending as long as needed.

Overall, I tried to finish Zoomcamp multiple times and was distracted, but I am in the final module of the Deep Learning course.",6
1qq4aw3,3,"I like the DataTalks Zoomcamp a lot and am about to go through it again actually.  Alexey ~~Andrei~~ is an awesome instructor for his portions.  Some of the others are less so, but overall it's pretty solid.  

I'm half way through Joe Reis's Deeplearning and I'm torn on whether to finish it or not.  A lot of the videos are reiterating a lot of content from his book (Fundamentals of Data Engineering).  It goes over a lot of the soft skills that a good DE needs, but less so on the technical side.  

His class spends a lot of time within AWS and you do pick up some skills with it, so it's not too bad, but I don't feel like it was sticking with me after the class was done.

Personally, do a few of the DataTalks zoomcamps - it has you writing and doing more than the other courses.  And since the zoomcamps can occasionally miss some steps, it will force you to either interact with the other students or hone your research skills in order to make things work correctly.

Lastly, you can go back through the DataTalks github and look at previous cohorts - they change up their tech stack some.  One year used Airflow for their orchestration, the next used Dagster and they might be using another one now.  Most orchestration tools are similar, so getting the basics done and then being familiar with other tools is a good thing.",4

Traditionally these are separate jobs. There are many use cases for keeping data in a DB, not just for dashboard stuff. Also for a reasonable amount of data, you can easily run into limits with what can easily fit into memory with Python. Your question really condenses to “what’s the point of databases, anyway?” Rather than anything to do with structured queries.",1
1qpkei4,5,Integrate a dbt project or use duckDB’s python api to replace any data processing done via pandas.,1
1qpkei4,6,"This is a de vs da context thing typically. You typically are not going to use both in the way that you currently are trying to. For da ad hoc querying from api and then analyzing data in notebook, Pandas (or better these days to future proof yourself, Polars) is more likely to be a go to. It is a discreet analysis engine. It is great for flattening api json to tables quickly, it is modular so you can do step wise analysis, it is very quick to export from.

But for proper oltp or olap based de pipeline dev with traceability and db centric design, sql will be your bread and butter much of the time. 

I have moved from da to de and have been using more and more duckdb as my sql engine lately. It is olap so it doesn't have schema registration reqs as ready to enforce, but it can lazy process parquet from s3 VERY efficiently without significant memory required. The thing about pandas is that all ops are in memory, which is fine if your dataset is less than your available system RAM, but when you work with larger data or cloud based flows (and associated costs) limiting memory dependency is an important optimization. Polars also can help with this because it has lazy loading ops.

At this point for data collection i pull from api and collect as polars then pass to duck to write raw data as partitioned parquet. If I can do transformations in duck I do it all in duck directly querying the parquet. If there is something messy that I have difficulty doing in duck, I will do what I can with duck and then take it back to polars for lazy in memory vector ops. If I need to quickly inspect data I use pandas converted tables because I am more well versed on pandas. I also use pandas where iteration line by line is necessary (like api lookup). Ultimately I will typically then write processed flattened consumable data as partitioned parquet. Then depending on case I use duck to query for analysis myself, or I serve flattened data as csv somewhere that it can be consumed by end usage app like power bi.",1

Here’s what I would do (as a leader.. this is what I’m looking for). I don’t know if its right - only time will tell:-

1 - get really good a defining and documenting for AI and business. How do I get an Agent to accelerate my work via context and not code. How do I show others the value I’m generating via acceleration of skills and effect using LLMs. Outcomes are all that count - 99% success but no value to business or customers doesn’t count as a win. 
2 - the technology moats will come down. Oracle tech stack isn’t going to be a thing in 2 years. You’re a plumber of data and the stack/implementations matter less as the coast of replacing them is coming down at a huge rate. Tech debt suddenly has way lower interests rates. 
3 - get good at big data again. Small stuff is gonna be usurped - that’s light work for a LLM. Big data is going to be hard because of cost and time. 

Start with YouTube - it’s a mess of influencers and hype men but there is some gold in there. 

Microsoft have a bunch of free GitHub learning on AI, ML, Big data on their repos. https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners is one. But they gave many. 

One thing to remember - the AI coding hype cycle has been around for 2 or so years of any value. You are still smarter than AI for sure. It can just type and think faster than you. So figure out how to make it your puppet, you will win. 

You WILL have an aha moment after 2-3 months and it will kick in. You will feel like you have a new superpower and feel like you have new energy.

You're still doing the same things in the new stacks, such as moving data from a file, API, or a database into a data warehouse (or lake) for further transformation and analysis. The fundamentals are still the same, so once you are able to figure out what the parallels are between the old and new tools you'll be in good shape.

Learning Python is highly recommended, with maybe Go or TypeScript as a backup language. Learning how to use Pandas and later PySpark will help too. Data pipelines are now typically coded by hand in a programming language, or else configured in a tool like DLT or Bruin (ingestion tools) along with other tools like DBT for transformation.

1qozv1g,10,"I prefer to build streaming first.  It's not about the speed for me.  

First, it's about control and localizing failure.  To use your examples; If I break up the CSV putting each row in it's own message, process each row one at a time, and one fails, that row fails, not the whole CSV.  That way I know exactly where the problem is and my users have access to the data that is not wrong while the issue with the failures gets handled.  Slapping a CDC implementation gives me a stream of all the changes to the relational database not just the end state when the incremental job ran.  If the load drastically increases the streaming system gives me a buffer without having to scale my workers unless the load sustains past my data latency requirements.  I've seen incremental jobs like that lock up a worker using all the memory because it was suddenly getting back much more from querying the relational database than it had been designed to handle.  It couldn't process anything until those workers got scaled up.

Second, I think you pointed out something with the fact that you're doing streaming on one system and batch on another.  You now effectively have two different types of systems you're maintaining.  If you go Kappa architecture as opposed to Lambda architecture you only have one type of system and that simplifies your operational overhead.  Even if streaming is harder to operate, you end up ahead.  I've never personally found a streaming system more operationally difficult but people do.  If you're only going to have one kind of system, I think it's easier to put a batch of work on a streaming system than to try and micro-batch your way to approximating a streaming system.

Lastly, and this is more personal, I like to think of data pipelines in a functional programming or even unix shell scripting model.  Mostly stateless operations with pipes in between.  Streaming tooling seems to map to this mental model better for me.",2

BQ to Athena, fair comparison even if it may not be perfectly apple to apple, BQ to Duckdb, hell no.",10
1qon39x,2,DuckDB ftw,2
1qon39x,3,"Agreed with other comments that this comparison doesn't make much sense, but just to go into a little more detail as to why...

BigQuery and Athena are both serverless cloud offerings. BigQuery abstracts away storage *and* compute. Athena abstracts away only compute, as you need to connect it to your object storage, but fundamentally, it's at least a little similar as an offering. You're not managing infrastructure with either of them, and they'll scale up parallelization to whatever level is necessary to ensure you get query results back in a reasonable amount of time. Because they're both built on serverless billing models, costs are very high on a query-by-query basis, but this can still be competitive in a real-world scenario if you have relatively low daily utilization.

Compare that to DuckDB, where you're using dedicated hardware with an embedded, columnar database. It abstracts away nothing - you're providing the hardware for storage and the hardware for compute. This is radically different. It works well at small scales, and because you're managing everything, it's great for heavy utilization and is extremely cost-effective on a query-by-query basis. It's also not distributed at all. Once you scale up past what a single machine can handle, you have graduated from DuckDB and need to move to something that can distribute the workload and handle scale.

Fundamentally, they're different tools solving different problems. So when you run a benchmark with 20 GB of data, you're using a very small scale of data that DuckDB is built for and which BigQuery/Athena are not. Because there's no downtime in benchmarking, you're also simulating what is effectively 100% utilization, the least favorable scenario for a serverless billing model. Of course DuckDB is going to end up looking good.

The way to meaningfully compare them on cost, at least, if you were for some reason trying to decide between these different options, would be to look at a simulated full month of usage.

10-15 years ago, finding someone who could code was more difficult than today, so companies took whoever they could find and gave them a good salary to do a lot of tech work. As smart phones and social media and e-commerce were still relatively new and starting to boom, these companies were just getting off the ground and needed someone, anyone, who could code. Those folks wore many hats in their job.

5 -7 years ago, as more people graduated college with CS degrees or did online bootcamps in hopes of getting these coding jobs, these companies found that they could be more selective in hiring. Okay, they found plenty of people who can code, but how many of them can code and interpret all this data we have? Thus the hiring direction narrows the scope of candidates.

In the last 5 years, we again see so many people getting CS degrees, learning to code, bootcamps etc. that companies can again be even more selective in their hiring. Okay, they found plenty of candidates that can code, can interpret data, and have AWS experience, now can we narrow the list down to candidates that have specifically our industry experience?

A couple of thoughts / questions:

- Any plans to expose the schema up front in a more “doc” style way? When I teach juniors, half the battle is helping them read schemas before writing queries.
- Might be cool to add “bad but works” vs “idiomatic” solutions, especially around CTE vs subquery, or when to use window functions instead of GROUP BY gymnastics.

You can even retrieve the results for each node in the computation graph if they're still in the cache. You can navigate up and down each intermediate node to see what was computed, what was pulled from cache, what didn't run, what errored, etc.

- either you fill missing elements with an array generator or watermarking on your actual storage

There is not right or wrong, so it's more about your constraints and how you query that data. Do you represent it visually? Are you more focused on aggregated kpis? Outliers? 

I'm often a fan of filling in DB because it just makes maintenance simpler and data warehouse storage costs are not crazy. Plus we are talking about numbers, not too heavy either

For extractions, I have some helper/utility code that handles generic things like abstracting away some API connections and setting up connections to datalake. The main python asset imports those helpers and then executes the actual logic of batch processing the extraction and loading to our datalake (hive configured).

For transformations, we have mostly moved away from python to sql since we can directly query external tables created from our hive datalake. But we still sometimes use python for the first layer where the data is weird file formats (like grib, netcdf, etc.) that require special processing - in such cases we read the files, convert to a dataframe, and then materialize it in our dwh. Our data platform's own built-in python materialization automatically handles incremental strategies and variable injections.

There are also very rare cases where data needs to be processed in a way thats not possible with sql - for example decoding airport weather reports like metar/taf, which require special python libraries to decode.

To answer your question about frameworks - we write functional code with very minimal object-oriented programming. For my team the rule of thumb is that a single python file/asset should contain all the logic tied to a single data entity/table/model. We never use notebooks (unless for quick local testing and adhoc stuff). In some cases, we extract different data from a single API endpoint, so for those cases we create a separate agent/helper to connect to the API and configure the parameters - this is the only case where we use a bit more oop.",7

Federated data warehouses are fundamentally unsound. Think about what has to be done to bounce a 1TB table in one warehouse against a 1TB table in the other. At some point, you will be duplicating the data across a relatively slow medium. The physics work against you. Federated warehouses are really only suitable for researching potential data and, sometimes, low volume OLTP systems.

I would bet dollars to donuts that *someone* will want to commingle these two data sets sooner rather than later, the question is whether you think that person will be low enough on the hierarchy that you can tell them to just do it in Excel, or whether it’ll be someone high enough that they’ll tell *you* to do it.",2

But in larger companies I think this is far better than a single warehouse for a number of reasons:

   * The team is closer to the business: they care more about delivering value and they generally understand the data better.

Never, unless there is a regulatory or legal requirement to do so. For example, GDPR requires data to stay within the country so global companies often have this need.  And I am pretty sure this could still be accomplished with one data platform like Databricks or Snowflake. 

When you are not a regulatory or legal mandate you have ways to ensure isolation in most platforms (I want to say all but that is even a bigger hot take).

Whats going to bite you the most is numpy rather than pandas here.

Second Answer:

Use polars + pandas, especially once you get everything setup in arrow types, its a seamless transfer of the dfs; while working with my team I use polars for the heavy stuff like merges, concats and stuff. ANd pandas for anything that needs to be verbose and redeable, like mathemtical operations or column based functions. Polars sucks at the whole thing because their approach of map_elements is inconsistent and expects something everytime. Polars also breaks their apis and their intended behavior quite a lot.

Just 1.0 to 3.0 from numpy to arrow should be about 4x boost in perf, polars + pandas can be 5-20x and pure polars can be 10-30x.

The main thing I love about polars are sinks and lazyframes. And the streaming engine, I had some pandas code which took 64gb of ram, mixed it with some polars and sink and now its down to 10gb of ram",18

However, many production systems run pandas.

Then you can compare performance and also what you think subjectively of the developer experience.

YMMV of course.",5

1qmfyr1,8,"i wouldnt think of it as “pandas 3 is magically faster than 1”. most of the real gains came in 2.x with the pyarrow backed memory model and better string / nullable dtypes. 3.0 is more about cleaning up legacy stuff and making that model the default, not a night and day jump.

for 20m+ rows, pandas can still struggle depending on ops, even with tons of ram. polars is legit faster for a lot of workloads, esp groupbys and scans, but it’s a diff mental model and ecosystem. the geopandas thing is real too, if you rely on that a lot, pandas is still the safer path. i’d prob modernize pandas first, then reach for polars where perf actually hurts instead of a full jump all at once.",2

1qmfyr1,10,"The difference is minimal, most of the work goes into keeping the project compatible with newer versions of Python and other libraries, small big fixes, and cleaning up the docs.

Pandas 3 introduces pandas.col() to avoid lambdas in filters and assign. Funny enough that change is probably one of the smallest changes in the codebase, while in my opinion it is by far the biggest change in the last 10 years of pandas development.

If you want to go into more details of what changed in pandas 3, I write about the main changes with practical examples:

Thank You",2
1qm4vul,3,"Nice idea, this is one of those boring problems that quietly ruins days when it goes wrong.

Stuff I’d absolutely want as a data engineer:

1. **Type + constraint awareness**  
   - Validate against a provided schema:  
     - max length for strings (so you catch truncation before the DB does)  
     - numeric ranges (e.g., > 0, integer vs decimal)  
     - allowed values / enums  
   - Nullability checks: flag missing values for NOT NULL columns.

2. **Key / relational checks**  
   - Primary key uniqueness (and optionally composite keys).  
   - Foreign key checks if the user can upload a reference list or connect to a DB to validate against existing keys.

3. **Encoding / whitespace / formatting**  
   - Strip or at least flag leading/trailing spaces (especially on keys and IDs).  
   - Detect inconsistent encodings or invalid characters.  
   - Normalize line endings and quote usage; flag malformed CSV rows.

4. **Header and column mapping**  
   - Detect duplicate headers.  
   - Option to map CSV columns to DB columns manually, and validate that all required DB columns are covered.

5. **Date/time and timezone sanity**  
   - Detect impossible dates (you mentioned this) but also:  
     - mixed formats in the same column (YYYY-MM-DD vs DD/MM/YYYY)  
     - timezone awareness or at least flagging multiple timezones / offsets in one column.

6. **Boolean and categorical checks**  
   - Validate booleans against an allowed set per target DB (true/false, 0/1, Y/N).  
   - Case sensitivity for codes where it matters (e.g., product codes).

7. **Performance / UX bits**  
   - Sampling mode for very large CSVs, with an option for full validation.  
   - A clear summary report: error counts per column, first N examples, and a “this row will break your insert” preview.

Feature ideas that might make this especially useful:

- **Schema import** from an existing database table (introspect table, then validate CSV against it).  
- **Safe default transformations**:  
  - trim spaces, normalize booleans, standardize date formats, remove thousands separators in numbers, etc., with a “show me what you changed” diff.  
- **Dry run mode**: actually run the generated SQL against a temp table or transaction and show what would fail.

If you really want data engineers to love it, being able to point it at a DB, pick a table, and have it auto-validate a CSV against that table’s schema and constraints would be killer.",1

""Ive been using a hammer for the past 10 years. I've built houses, boxes, fences and doors. I know how to frame, tile roof, and even straighten a car bumper with it. What tool should I learn next? Im eyeing a skilsaw, nail gun, and even power drill.""

Instead, focus on the meta. That is: engineering for solving business problems. The tool you use to build systems doesnt matter as much as successful execution and bringing value to the business. Can you model processes? If someone gave you a process model, can you translate that into technological implementation? Can you translate a process model into a data model?

If you wanna get better at python, do leetcode exercises and learn data structures and algorithms. By accident, you will learn how to program in general— in any language. The real value is in learn how to think abstractly and creating an algorithm that will solve the business need efficiently and correctly. The brand of language or server is a political opinion or strategic decision (eg: python has the best tooling for DS).

If you want to learn system design, build a python app from zero, no framework. It'll teach you how to organize code, how to build mental models around your code, separation of concerns, IO, dataflow, system orchestration, deployments, etc. Learn what tools exist within your ecosystem of choice. This will give you what you need to think abstractly— macro decision making, not micro. Focus on big picture like a tech lead (not like a CEO or CTO, thats too big picture).

My path away from Microsoft started with an EdX free course on learning Linux. I  learned that Shell scripting could do way more than I had realised. Powershell was in its early years so this increased my interest in Powershell too.

Because of the deadly duos rabid hatred of Microsoft I had to learn a lot in a short space of time on an alien OS and with a lot of alien tech. One of the system admits taught me some basic Docker skills. This let me build a small set of images for the tech we were migrating to.  As a Dockerfile is a very small I could reproduce it at home to build the images I wanted.

I'd say basic Docker skills are essential even if all you do is build your own learning labs.  Look for courses by Nigel Poulton.

For Python, make sure you get comfortable with virtual environments. Again, ring fenced learning but you will need this in a Python environment.

Learn about PyTest and Behave for testing your Python code. There are some specific data testing libraries out there. 

Once you build learning labs and are comfortable with testing approaches, life becomes a lot easier.

I built an ETL framework using an early version of Spark. It was effective, what the CTO insisted on, but was overkill for the barely TB data we had at the time. I'm amazed its so widely used given that few companies genuinely have Big Data problems.  Databricks has Spark at its heart.

My usual process is to get them to explain the current process (if one exists) and what they are trying to solve.

If I have a solution formulating in mind then I'll explain what it is as simply as I can while getting their opinion, this usually leads to them asking Qs and revealing potential edge cases etc I need to solve for.

Bottom line is... my process is to listen, question and collaborate. It's not about the solution they propose, but why they are proposing it and my job is to design a simpler version of it that ticks all the boxes.

If you're trying to write software then yes it's not great because you can't really write comprehensively testable software without functions.

I have bad news for you if you need production-level code....

On a more serious note, if you use an IDE like VScode, you can incrementally build code logic with interactive code execution like in a notebook and also become familiar with how to use the debugger for your programming language. Once you have an initial chunk of code that does what you want, parameterise it and stick it in a function. Then write some tests for it, ideally. A parameterised notebook is not all that different from a very lengthy function. You just want to separate the code in your notebook into functions so that each function is doing a single thing and returning/producing a single thing.

It will be slower at first because you're rewiring your brain to use a new process and interface, but you'll get faster and the benefits can be great if you're doing anything that's a deliverable and you want some quality assurance.

Just last week I interviewed a guy who seemed to be using AI to craft his answers. Although some answers were obviously not scripted, and he seemed to know what he was talking about, he still seemed like he was using an AI interview tool. After talking to some of the recruiters familiar with his region of the world it was apparent that this was VERY common and candidates felt they had to do it to stay competitive. 

We had a follow-up interview where we told him that we all use AI tools in out jobs and that we can't fault anyone for using them, but we wanted to hear his answers unassisted. We made it clear that it was OK to say ""I don't know"" or ""I don't understand the question"". The interview went much better. There was some language barrier and he didn't understand all the questions as asked, but when clarified he was fine and gave good answers. When he didn't know something he said so. It turns out his resume was real, he did know what he was talking about. 

I think going forward we will address the use of AI, let them know it's ok for some aspects of their job and even for helping them interview. We also need to get good at asking the right questions.

if airflow feels too heavy, look at dagster or prefect, similar concepts but less operational overhead. or if ur dbt transformations are the main thing being orchestrated, dbt cloud has built in scheduling that might be enough.

I have much more experience with Kafka Connect and sure it has it's pain points but it is the best in class solution for real-time data at scale.  Although i will add Red Panda is an increasing an option that I would keep on the table.

The problem with the managed solution is they become expensive and slow if you are working with any volume of data or any high update frequency.  

If you have small data or don't have real-time requirements the managed solution are all great. Currently we run Kafka connect and Open Source Airbyte. We are slowly moving away from Airbyte, but it works great for all of our small tables that need to be updated ever 15 minutes or less.",2

I used Pandas and excel-related Python libraries to automate most of the Excel work I was doing. 

I learned a ton through that process and then went on to take the Data Engineering specialization through Deeplearning.ai to learn some more about what data engineering entails and some of the tools I might expect to use in a data engineering role.

1qjwtpf,1,"Short answer: yes, but not with a built-in “copy workflow” button.

AWS Glue workflows can be migrated without recreating everything in the console, but it takes either an API based export or infrastructure as code.

One option is to pull the workflow definition from the source account using the Glue API. `GetWorkflow` with `IncludeGraph=true` gives you the workflow structure and dependencies. From there you also need to export each referenced job, crawler, and trigger using `GetJob`, `GetCrawler`, and `GetTrigger`. In the target account, you recreate the workflow with `CreateWorkflow`, then recreate jobs, crawlers, and triggers so the DAG lines back up. This works well for a one-time move, but you still have to fix account specific things like IAM role ARNs, KMS keys, S3 bucket names, connections, and any hard coded account IDs in job arguments.

The cleaner long-term approach is to turn the workflow into infrastructure as code. Glue workflows and triggers are supported in both CloudFormation and Terraform. Once modeled, you can deploy the same definition to another account with only variable changes for account specific resources. This avoids ever doing a manual rebuild again and is what most teams settle on after the first migration.

In practice, if this is a one-off accident recovery, scripting against the Glue APIs is usually fastest. If you expect multiple environments or future moves, converting the workflow to CloudFormation or Terraform is the better investment.",3
1qjwlaz,1,"Also - a further thought on the modeling aspect before I run away and get roasted... is there modeling considerations to cut down on the memory usage with CouchBase?

However I would not use Clickhouse for a traditional DWH if I had the choice of remaining on BQ.",9
1qjvrps,2,"(Upfront: I work for ClickHouse)

I would anticipate that it would be cheaper, but I suppose it depends on how you use it and your ability to optimise. ClickHouse is a much more efficient engine than BQ query-for-query, but how you optimise your capacity on k8s is veeery different to how you'll have optimised cost on BQ. 

E.g. if you're using BQ with on-demand pricing and query infrequently, the cost-per-query would be higher on BQ than CH, but that might still work out cheaper overall than running your own infra 24/7. But if you're running lots of queries consistently throughout the day, that might flip the other way, where the infra overhead is worth it. You need to look at your usage pattern and work that out.",9
1qjvrps,3,"We’ve moved several years ago from BQ to self-hosted ClickHouse, and I, as mostly analyst, miss those times a lot. Didn’t have to think about all ClickHouse “features” and just wrote sql. Life was easier",6
1qjvrps,4,What's your current BigQuery cost? How many users are using it? How big is your data?,2
1qjvrps,5,"As always, it depends on your use cases and workload patterns. IMHO you would only save $$ with a self-managed CH cluster yourself if you had an always-on, steady workload that required high performance queries.  Otherwise you need to set up auto-scaling and scale-to-zero, which both BQ and ClickHouse Cloud offer.

There’s a borderline overwhelming degree of emphasis here on specific technologies and file types etc. when it really just sounds like they wanted to understand if you knew what kind of logic belongs in each layer and roughly what the process would look like.

1qj0hi3,1,"It's difficult to understand your question:  moving data from OLAP to OLAP **what**?  database, server, system?  What's ""ADBC""?

So, first off, definitions:

   * Data Warehousing: process, not a place.  It's the process of curating data to enable reuse by transforming, versioning and integrating it.  The place could be a product optimized for data warehousing like Snowflake, or it could be Postgres, DuckDB, or just a set of flat files or a spreadsheet (if say you're warehousing your bowling league's scores).
   * OLAP: On-Line Analytical Processing: typically a service or system that supports analytical queries.  It might use DuckDB, Snowflake, Postgress or a set of flat files.  And it might use a dimensional model, One-Big-Table (OBT), or a transactional model.  And the queries may be handled by a middleware or API layer without giving clients the ability to use SQL.

So, there's an overlap between the two concepts, but it's not 100%: a warehouse doesn't have to involve OLAP, and an OLAP system doesn't have to involve warehousing.

With that in mind, there's lots of valid reasons why people might move data between OLAP systems, here's a few:

   * Warehouse/Mart pattern - a warehouse may publish its data to smaller data marts that use different technology or that have different retention/security/data elements, or that support different parts of the business.
   * Master Data Management - one system may publish dimensional data for reuse by another data mart, warehouse or OLAP system.
   * Scaling - one system may push a copy of its data to a failover or peer system.",13
1qj0hi3,2,"I would say it’s an anti-pattern in the sense you don’t have a single OLAP platform. If you are moving a fact or dim from one DWH to another you are opening the gate to potential data inconsistencies, straying from a single source of truth.

However, as anyone who has worked in an enterprise will tell you, large companies have many tools. They don’t choose Snowflake vs Databricks, they have both. In those scenarios, it makes sense that there will be OLAP to OLAP pipelines. Additionally, tech debt is a big thing. I know of customers that instead of deprecating Terradata, they just replicate it to Snowflake because the effort to rebuild it is not worth it. They would rather prioritize the investment in new initiatives.",4
1qj0hi3,3,"Do have a link to this post? I would say its too aggressive to call it an anti pattern. I think there are cases where you can leverage zero copy. For example if you keep your data stored as Iceberg or Delta Lake, you can use different engines on the same data without moving it. But as you said, there are cases where moving it is just going to make sense, such as:

* Using DuckDB on the edge
* Compliance (ex send redacted or de-anonymized data between regions)
* Data Sharing with 3rd party vendors or customers (ex. send data from your BigQuery to your customers' Redshift)
* Archiving (ex use a cheaper/slower system for historical data)",1

Tools like Atlas & Flyway can solve database versioning issues, and give you defined states of your db for every env.

Avoid `SELECT *` in your ETLs. Define the columns so jobs fail loudly and not silently.

""our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets"" sounds suspicious to me, like updates to db's are being done automatically and without warning. Perhaps roll those changes up into a daily release branch with slack messages and announcements to avoid surprising people.

1qifo47,2,"> We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.

It's completely normal to not see ""reality"" before reaching production. Unless it's highly critical and you are allowed to maintain a live copy of production in test environment, the test data is inevitably less complete. The smart and efficient solution is to have a proper analysis of the different cases existing in production, and use them to build your test data, ideally by the upstream team that is responsible for this data. Consider that it cannot be complete, try to make it good enough. Don't think you can predict all future use cases, the solution for those is proper error logging, monitoring and alerting, so you can react fast when they will happen.

> In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing.

Teams should be free to have their team-only development environment were they can break everything, but there should be another test environment that is relatively stable to allow downstream usage of data like you need. I think you need to talk about having such a stable test environment with the engineering management, in my experience it was mostly called ""staging"". It's not supposed to be a copy of ""production"", and it's better if it is not for information security, but it should be a good simulation of production cases to test the code edge cases (as I described above).

In our case, our dev environment is our local laptops. We have hand crafted test files crafted to represent the different cases, and we are able to run full flows locally with either our tools running locally or mocking. Local allows to iterate much faster than if you have to deploy and rely on non-local tools. The unit tests and full flow tests are automated to be able to run in CICD or on request on PRs if they are too slow for systematic run. 

Then there is the company's staging environment that is fed by upstream teams with simulated data representative of production, and the same code and tools as production. There we can run our code in the same tool environment as production. 

> Upstream tables aren’t versioned

What does this mean? If the code that creates/alter these tables is not versioned, that's pretty bad. The process needs to go through a proper CICD. Or do you mean there's no number you can track to know if the table schema changed?

> schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?

Upstream table changes need to be communicated. This is not negotiable for platform stability and needs to be taken to engineering management. They need to establish a proper channel, for example: ticket (with PR links), documentation page, announcement in dedicated channel, regular meetings to plan changes and exceptional meetings for emergencies. A team should only be allowed to deploy such change once the communication process has been respected and the reception by downstream teams has been confirmed.  
This also means the upstream team is responsible for updating staging so it matches the change and you can properly test it in staging.",3
1qifo47,3,"> Related question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. 

> Is this common? 

Absolutely.  There are some rare scenarios where it doesn't happen all the time - like the upstream system *never* changes, or is run by the exact same team doing the ETL work.  But in almost all other cases it's a complete mess.

Plus there's other bad cases like where the upstream system adds a new column, you're using a solution that provides some schema evolution capabilities like Fivetran, so your ETL process just silently ingests the new column - but that new column isn't actually used by anything - and it now has 50% of your costs allocated to it from a different column everyone is using.

> What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?

Data contracts & publishing domain objects:

   * Upstream system publishes a ""domain object"" any time any field within the domain changes.  A domain is a higher-level abstraction like user, customer, invoice, supplier, etc.  And the domain object is typically a denormalized collection of related info.
   * The domain object could be published to a messaging system, which could get ingested directly, or simply redirect messages into a file on say s3.  Or maybe the upstream system just writes all pending domain objects to s3 every 5-15 minutes.
   * And the domain object is locked down with a data contract.  This contract is kept in version control, and both the source & target teams can use it to validate all data being sent & received.  I prefer jsonschema for this, and use it to identify columns, their types, as well as info like min/max values, min/max string length, null rules, enumerated values, regex formats, etc, etc, etc.",2

what really sets you apart is how well you can design or tailor a solution based on actual business needs. two companies can use the same tech stack but design it very differently depending on cost, scale, data volume, and reporting needs. a big part of the job is deciding what to use, what not to use, and how to connect things in a clean way. delegation and leveraging other people’s skills also matters once you’re working on real projects.

most data engineering jobs today are still around reporting and analytics pipelines, so don’t ignore that part. if your goal is to earn more, then real-time streaming systems are worth learning. they’re harder, higher risk, and higher value, so fewer people do them well.

at this point, tools like snowflake, dbt, databricks, unity catalog, etc are almost basics. just knowing them isn’t enough anymore. the real skill is making smart choices across these tools, estimating costs, and building something that actually works for the client without overengineering. that’s where good data engineers stand out.",2

Evidence is more developer focused and works well if you want version controlled, code-based reporting.

Hex
- Been a while since I looked at this, but I would say visualization flexibility was not as robust compared to Tableau or Sigma.
- Definitely felt more like a notebook and exploration tool useful for scientists and analytics but maybe not for business-oriented user.
- Great for “data apps” beyond just a visualization tool.

Omni
- Great if you are moving from Looker. It will feel very familiar.
- Very structured data mart/semantics layer.
- Close to mature in terms of features but I would say Sigma is more mature.

Sigma
- I would say this is the closest to Tableau in terms of maturity of features.
- Usage logs is more convenient to use than Tableau.
- Actions allow great flexibility in both changing visuals or filtering or more.

* **Hex**: best for analyst velocity. Weak if you need a governed explore experience for lots of business users.
* **Omni**: best “modern Looker-lite” vibe. Strong semantic model + self-serve exploration. You still need someone to own modeling/definitions. Founders' mission was basically ""if we built Looker in 2025, what it would look like"". 
* **Sigma**: best for business adoption. Spreadsheet UX on warehouse data. Governance can sprawl fast unless you enforce metric patterns.
* **Evidence**: best for narrative, versioned reporting. Feels like “analytics as code/docs”. Not an ad-hoc slice-and-dice tool.

1. ETL Pipeline: Ingest data from public APIs (maybe weather, finance, or social media), clean and transform it, and store it in a cloud database. Visualize results or build a simple dashboard to display insights.
2. Data Warehouse Project: Set up a mini data warehouse using open source tools (like PostgreSQL, DuckDB, or even cloud warehouses if allowed by your school). Populate it with multiple sources and practice schema design, partitioning, and basic analytics queries.
3. Batch vs Stream: Compare batch ETL (e.g., with Airflow or Prefect) and simple streaming (Kafka or just a basic pub/sub) on a dataset. Even if you use sample scripts, explaining the trade-offs is valuable.
4. End-to-End Analytics: Choose a topic (like campus resource usage or student performance if you can get anonymized data), gather, clean, and enrich the data, and display it in a lightweight front-end. This gives you a taste of the full stack.

Don’t worry about building something massive; depth of understanding matters more than shiny complexity.

1qha2l9,1,"To help everyone

There are (at least) two types of problems in the world of business.

One is measurement / analysis. This is things like ""how much did we sell last month?"" These are solved by data. databases, warehouses, SQL, BI, semantic layers. 

The other one is process / logic / workflow. This is things like ""what sales actions should I take with this customer over the next 3 months to improve my chances of a win?"" Or ""what data should I use to answer this question?""  These are solved by different kinds of data, usually qualitative in nature - metadata, documents, runbooks, applications, code, vector searches, RAG, and graphs. 

""Context graph"" is a buzzword - it's just a graph database, the same ones we've had for 40+ years. The ""context"" just describes its purpose - a tool for providing context to AI models and agents.

Offloading context, just like offloading data catalogs and other tools, help AI agents by preventing them from hallucinating, drifting, or getting context overload.

Just like we don't expect an airline pilot to handle all measurement, observation, and emergency procedures themselves, we give them accurate dashboards, runbooks, and a support crew to help them achieve their tasks.

Data engineering obviously has a role in both problems in terms of investing, transforming, and managing data into data warehouses and graph databases.",43
1qha2l9,2,"I've heard people muttering about context graphs, but nobody's been able to define it for me. I know about knowledge graphs, and am wondering if a context graph is where you apply a knowledge graph in order to feed more contextually appropriate content to an LLM than an equivalent vector-database equipped RAG search would normally do - but it can't just be that.",27
1qha2l9,3,"The meta for llms changes every week, so don't get two freaked out about it.  

Business context is usually captured with either RAG or graphs.  RAG uses a vector similarity search algorithm to look up related information and graphs rely on nodes and edges to connect relationships in your data.  Basically look at how Neo4j works.  They have been talking about the graph approach for a while, but barriers are how your data is organized/tagged as it's less effective the fewer relationships you have.  That's not easy to establish depending on what your metadata looks like.  Also massive graph dbs tend to not be that performant.  

You can still get pretty good results with them, especially for document search use cases or something like that.  But there are also people talking about how tensor based LLMs are limited and not going to get us to the promised land and the next step might be difusion models or something else.  AWS also was talking about how they are maxing out what they can do with generic LLMs in training and how they could be more effective if they had access to actual business data to train on (not going to happen).  Agentic systems are the current hot thing where you can create ""tools"" for the LLM to use based on the context.  Like if a user asks an accounting question, the LLM can call an accounting agent that might have textual, RAG or graph resources to answer the call.  

It's interesting but also infuriating that there are so many approaches and the ""best"" approach changes almost weekly.  It's still very early in AI development so I guess I would say don't freak out about learning one thing as it will likely change, but definitely do get into working with AI is future work will depending on it.

Curious to see if Vinted leans into open standards, a strong internal platform, or something more bespoke. Anyone know if they use a single orchestration layer like Airflow or if they stitch together different tools per team?",1
1qh4sp0,1,"I'm in a team that built everything on AWS services, with similar amounts of incoming data.

It was fine at first. As long as everything was simple with a single region and incoming product, and a few people had been working on it and had direct experience with how everything was done, then the 'quirks' were kept to a minimum and everyone knew them.

Then as new team members got onboarded things got harder. People had to be taught all the quirks of which role to use when creating a glue job vs an interactive notebook, they had to be shown the magic command boilerplate to get glue catalog and iceberg tables working, they needed to know the bucket that was set up for output for Athena queries. With more people working not everyone could be across everyone else's work, so people weren't familiar with how various custom jobs and scripts had been made, and because each job was its own mini vertical stack there was a lot of repeated components in infrastructure, policies, ci/cd scripts.

As new use cases came on that didn't fit the mould new ways of doing things had to be added. Kinesis and firehose come in, airflow orchestration gets tasked for some small transforms while others go to glue jobs. Someone wants a warehouse/database to query, so redshift is added. Exports to third party processors are needed as are imports, so more buckets, more permissions. API ingestions are needed so in come lambda functions, with each one coded and deployed differently because nobody can see what everyone else is doing.

Then finally users need access to data, and the team just isn't set up for it. There is no central catalog with everything, it is spread out across half a dozen services, and the only way to know where anything is or goes is to dig through the code. That 'worked' for the DE team, since they were the ones doing the digging, but there was no effective way to give access to everything. Every request for data took days or weeks to finalise, and often required more pipelines to move it to where it could be accessed.

We're moving to Databricks soon. It gives a unified UI for DE and other teams to access the data, you get sql endpoints, you can run basic compute on single-node 'clusters', it has orchestration built in, it gives you a somewhat easier way to manage permissions, and it works for both running your own compute and giving data access. Instead of a mishmash of technologies that don't make a unified platform, you get a consistent experience.

You'll just have to pay extra since it is doing a good portion of that unification work for you.

If you had a hundred DE type roles it might be more cost effective to stick with base aws services, and have a dedicated team focused on dx, standards, and productivity, to cut out the managed compute cost. But if you're just 3 people, you're probably not there.",42
1qh4sp0,2,"Full disclosure: I work at Databricks.

One of the benefits of Databricks is that your engineers don't have to do the work of stitching all of those AWS services together. This is especially relevant for you since you're such a small team. Databricks will allow your team to spend less time on infra work and more time building your data  lakehouse.",21
1qh4sp0,3,"Everyone suggesting Databricks here. I’m part of a company where we chose to build our Lakehouse 5 years ago on AWS.
We have an amazing solution with around 10 platform engineers, 50 engineers working on the platform and 20k end users.

We recently did a full analysis of total cost (cloud costs and payroll) of using Databricks vs our Platform and we are definitely much much more cost effective.

That said, it required great leadership and product vision and it works because we’re a big company with specific needs that were not answered by Databricks at the time - for example when Iceberg was first out we went all in meanwhile Databricks kept saying it wasn’t their priority and pushed delta lake.

Now I would say Databricks is so easy to get into and has improved so much over the years… if we had to start now I think Databricks would be the go to",7
1qh4sp0,4,"I am in the Data Science/MLOps, but tend to work with Data Engineers. Take my opinion with some level of salt. I work on the Databricks platform full time. I have experience with spark, orchestration, A.I. Agents, etc. 

Databricks can do everything you listed. It is not the best in each category. Airflow is a superior orchestration tool than Databricks Workflows, for example. However Databricks provides tools in all categories that are more than good enough.

I find myself surprised how easy most things are. I usually  do a POC with a G.U.I. first.  Then reimplement with code, checking against the G.U.I. POC as I go. There is a G.U I. for Databricks Workflows and A.I. Agents. In general, everything seems to be as easy as possible, with good default settings. 

The advantage of having good enough tools in broad categories that all integrate well with each other makes life easy.

Measured against AWS, Databricks is more expensive. Your company can either pay more for compute ( go with Databricks) or pay more to expand the team with specialized people (AWS). Expensive compute is cheaper than expensive specialists.

Plus Databricks is moving to everything runs on serverless. In practice, I would say 80% to 90% of prod code runs on serverless. I see this improving with time.

Closing remark. Databricks is a thought leader. They have made many open source software that everything else is compared to. (Spark, MLflow, DeltaLake,...). Databricks competitors run Databricks open source software. Agent bricks hosts 20+ LLMs out of the box. I don't know what the future holds, but I bet Databricks drives it.",4

\- Delta Lake with ACID transactions, Time Travel, Schema Enforcment / Evolution, Z-Ordering, etc

\- Spark Declarative Pipelines for ETL

\- Databricks Jobs for orchestration

\- Unity Catalog for governance

\- Dashboards for reporting

\- Lakeflow Connect for connecting to multiple data sources, with built-in connectors

\- Delta Sharing for sharing data externally

\- ML and GenAI Features (I haven't worked with this yet)",3
1qh4sp0,8,"I built up a data lakehouse architecture starting 5 years ago and we had to stich AWS services together. Which worked well and performance was inline what we needed. We used all of the technologies you listed except data tone and only a bit of lake formation. Then we wanted to have a business facing data catalogue with lineage and there wasn’t much available in AWS. As of 2026 I would argue that is still the case. For data catalogue we used OpenMetadata. For hosting we used EKS btw.

Long story short it takes a lot of development effort to put all of these technologies together and to maintain it. It works well once done and it is scalable. 

But if I would do it again I would use Databricks in 2026. Gets you started quickly. Downside will be cost as you have to pay for DBUs on top off AWS cost.  Arguably you would need less data developers which could pay for the additional cost.  I know this is a bit off a sticking point nobody wants to think about. But if you plan to use your devs to build the AWS solution then you already covered the dev cost. If you go with Databricks you may need less data devs, assuming that some part of their time is currently used for infrastructure work. If the new AWS architecture would need more devs than the argument would be that Databricks would allow you to operate with the current number of devs.

If you decide to go with databricks use an open source table format like iceberg to reduce vendor locking. Also bear in mind, databricks can support all of the requirements you listed, but is not best in class for all of them like BI, orchestration, gen ai etc. the core is around spark and related services.",2
1qh4sp0,9,"If you want to move faster, go with Databricks by leveraging Native lake house(delta, streaming, governance) that's all integrated. It comes with much less Ops burden, and Unity Catalog is far simpler than Stitching together Lake Formation, Glue, IAM. However, it comes with a price: vendor lock-in, and it can get expensive if you don't control clusters well.
If you choose to DIY on AWS, you'll need to spend a lot of time maintaining instead of delivering because of high operational overhead. AWS self made stack makes sense only if the platform engineering is strong. But for small team with high volume, Databricks is good choice from my POV",2

1qgyrpt,1,"Yeah, this is a really normal point of confusion when you move from DA work into ingestion side DE. The big mindset shift is that schemas tell you how tables relate, but they don’t tell you how data changes. Streams only show what Snowflake sees as new or updated rows since the last run, so if the source system quietly edits an old record, you’ll never see that unless you deliberately go back and reprocess it. That’s why a lot of pipelines use a lookback window (reloading the last N days every run) or just full refresh smaller tables. If the source doesn’t give you a reliable “last updated” field or CDC feed, you kind of have to assume old data can change and design around that. For tables without dates, truncating by time doesn’t really make sense. Those usually get merged by a stable business key, or fully rebuilt if they’re small enough. The “forked” tables usually follow the lifecycle of the parent record, not the ingestion date. In general, when you’re trying to understand ingestion, I’d ask “how does this data change in the source system?” rather than “how do these tables join.” Once you answer that, the truncate vs merge decisions start to feel a lot more obvious",3

Your Python service pulls data from the carpark API and publishes events as they arrive. From there, you usually want some kind of streaming or messaging layer to decouple ingestion from processing, so bursts or failures don’t break everything. Next comes processing, where you clean the data, handle duplicates or late events, and compute whatever metrics you care about (occupancy, availability trends, etc.). This can be done in near-real-time or small micro-batches depending on complexity. The processed output then lands in a store that’s optimized for querying or visualization, which your frontend reads from. The key ideas to focus on early are idempotency, schema consistency, and what “real time” actually means for your use case (seconds vs minutes).

You can also try implementing dbt, it fits really well with the Medallion architecture and tools like Dagster (for orchestration). With dbt and Dagster, you can easily write test cases and handle data quality checks.

For monitoring and alerts, I’ve found Grafana to be free, simple, and effective to set up.

I can’t comment much on your architecture since it depends on your data and use case. If Medallion fits your needs, that’s fine, but you can also experiment with Kimball or a hybrid approach to understand trade-offs better.

TPC-DS generators are useful too, but they can feel a bit artificial compared to semi-messy realworld data. You can also look at public datasets from places like AWS Open Data or Google BigQuery public datasets and just pull subsets under 100GB.

Medallion isn’t the *only* layering pattern, it’s just the most common mental model. Some teams add things like a “raw but validated” layer, or domainoriented marts instead of a single gold layer. The naming matters less than being clear about guarantees (schema stability, data quality, latency).

For monitoring, beyond infra metrics, it’s worth looking into data-quality checks at the Spark/Iceberg level (row counts, freshness, null checks). Tools like Great Expectations or simple custom checks in Airflow go a long way in a POC. Scaling pain usually shows up first around small-file problems, metadata growth, and orchestration complexity rather than raw storage cost.

1qg2qf4,4,"My Short answer to this would be not really, at least not without changes. Spark and classic MapReduce look similar conceptually, but they’re different execution models and APIs. Spark doesn’t natively run old MapReduce jobs the way YARN used to, so there isn’t a true “drop in” compatibility layer. In practice, teams usually rewrite or wrap the jobs. For simple map → aggregate → write patterns like you described, the migration is often straightforward in Spark (even more so if it’s just daily aggregations feeding Hive tables). The bigger friction points tend to be custom input/output formats (like Protobuf), assumptions about reducers, or job-level configs that don’t translate cleanly. If zero code changes is a hard requirement, that’s a red flag you’d need classic MapReduce support somewhere. Otherwise, the realistic path is incremental rewrites: validate the Spark output against the existing Hive tables, then retire the MapReduce jobs one by one. Most teams find the effort manageable once they accept it’s a migration, not a switch flip",1

Since u have great YOE, I assume u had fair experience with SQL jobs. What I am doing now is catch up on fundamentals, u will realized ppl here are quite tool-centric. But as starters, just pick one ecosystem. And move to the bronze layer side of things, think of design engineering decisions. Cost-performance trade-offs, synergy with your current companies infrastructure, don’t overengineer over a futile problem.

A lot of people who get bored in senior analyst roles feel that same shift, less enjoyment from “telling the story” and more from building the systems and models that make everything work. If you enjoy data modeling, Python, and building tools that reduce friction for others, that’s already a big piece of modern DE work. Many DE roles today are less about pure infra and more about enabling analytics at scale, which fits your background well. You’re not starting from zero, you’re just moving closer to the plumbing. On the ITIL / process side yes, it’s more structured, and that can be frustrating at first. The upside is fewer fire drills and clearer ownership the downside is slower change and more ceremony. People coming from “fast and loose” teams usually struggle with pace more than the work itself, but most adapt once they see the stability benefits. As for frustrations, you’ve already named most of them unclear requirements, data quality issues, tribal knowledge, and legacy decisions you inherit.

As long as the upstream silver/gold models are well-defined and versioned, referencing them directly doesn’t really break dbt’s model it just means you’re treating that layer as an interface rather than something that’s constantly reshaped. Many teams do this to avoid unnecessary rebuilds or to keep reporting logic simple.

The code usually doesn't run, and these people are completely closed off to constructive criticism, so nothing has improved for weeks. They do like to bitch about us, though. 

My manager came to me yesterday to tell me I needed to be more patient and to train one of these guys more. There is no training taking place, because they're not actually attempting to do what is asked of them. Copying and pasting things into and put of an LLM is not learning or trying, it's just creating slop. Ive gone over the changes that need made to a file three times now and have shown them the exact lines where changes need to be made. Something that I've told them is only a 3 line update turns into a 600+ line diff.

Last week, I got on a call with my tech lead and one of these guys and went through every single line he had updated in a PR and asked him to explain his design decisions. He literally couldn't explain what the code did at all. 

So, at least on my team, it's a huge issue. We are hiring people that aren't competent because our leadership assumes that any idiot can generate code via an LLM, so they're hiring the cheapest idiots they can find.

You can develop a simple cron job that syncs on a daily basis or every few hours and loads those drive files to SQL Server. 

Since SQL server is already there there would be some sort of schema present. Load your csv files to the same schema present in SQL server. 


That way your SQL Server acts as a single source of truth for data present both in SQL Server + Drive folder.

1qf5k36,5,"The most effective approach is to separate storage from indexing. You should treat your SQL server as the Control Plane and a dedicated file store (like S3, Azure Blob, or a MinIO instance) as the Data Plane. Your Python script functions as a gateway that pulls data from your various sources and subjects it to a strict validation suite before it ever reaches the ML team. Instead of raw CSVs or SQL dumps, have your script convert the data into Parquet files; this format is compressed, schema-enforced, and significantly faster for ML frameworks to load than standard text files. Once the script validates and saves the file to your central storage, it should write a record to a ""Manifest"" table in your SQL server. This record includes the file path, a unique version ID, a checksum to prevent corruption, and the results of your quality tests. The ML team then simply queries this SQL table to find the URI of the latest ""Verified"" dataset, eliminating the need for email threads and manual downloads.
This setup transforms your manual 70GB bottleneck into a robust, versioned data pipeline that maintains the SWE standards of your core application.",1
1qf5k36,6,"70GB???? Looks like data governance failure. Pick a single source of truth first, either SQL Server or object storage and stop letting files float around untracked. If you stay on prem, you can use scheduled ingestion to pull CSVs and DB tables into a controlled landing zone and then version and validate before ML touches anything.

A cron Python script will work short term but will break on retries, partial loads and schema drift. If you want something more durable without building your own pipeline framework, tools like Integrate.io or even SSIS can standardize ingestion from file shares and SQL into a central store with basic validation.",1

1qf0y19,2,"I don’t think you’re wrong to be frustrated, and you’re definitely not the only one who’s felt this with Fabric. From the outside it looks less like “networking is unimportant” and more like Fabric being designed as a very opinionated SaaS first, and an Azure-native platform second. MPEs feel awkward because they’re basically abstracting VNET concepts into something Fabric can control end to end. That gives Microsoft tighter isolation, simpler UX for less technical users, and easier multi-tenant guarantees, but it also means every new resource type needs explicit support. That doesn’t scale well for power users who expect networking to just work like it does in Synapse or Databricks. The slow rollout of MPE types is probably a mix of security review, product prioritization, and yes, commercial incentives. Fabric clearly pushes “bring data into OneLake” patterns first, and anything that bypasses that path feels like a second-class citizen. Whether that’s intentional cost pressure or just product focus, the effect is the same for customers. I don’t think it’s a lack of technical capability so much as Fabric still deciding who it’s really for. Right now it feels optimized for managed ingestion and analytics inside the ecosystem, not for complex private networking scenarios. Until that changes, Fabric is hard to recommend as a full replacement for Synapse/Databricks if deep network control is a requirement.

The main shift is going from notebooks and models to systems. Instead of just asking if a model works, start thinking about whether it can run reliably, be monitored, and be understood by others later on. A good place to start is core software fundamentals like Git workflows, writing clean modular Python, logging and basic testing, then Docker basics. After that, focus on understanding end-to-end pipelines (ingest to transform then store then serve) rather than individual tools. If you can, build one small but real pipeline on your own. Even a simple project teaches more about engineering tradeoffs than a lot of courses.

Best-practice in terms of this kind of thing is to know the trade-offs), implement observability from day 1 (that can be writing logs and checking them daily in cloudwatch at the start).

Note that MANY of your trade-offs and architectural decisions will depend on what kind of requirements are required downstream. In fact, the very first thing you need to map is who are the data consumers and what are their needs - mind you that more often than not the end-users have very vague requirements (it is often a big part of the job to translate vague business requirements into technical choices - also, often what they want is different than what they need). If applicable to your case: also talk to upstream stakeholders (feks, in my company, the data is generated by services written by developers, so I have to sync with them to understand what is doable or not in terms of data serving/latency)

For low code and minimal manual work, managed connectors are usually less painful.

I’ve been through many DE and DE role adjacent interviews, and SQL almost always comes up. Know some technicals like order of execution in a SQL query, CTE’s, Window functions. I have never been asked any python technicals (have done a few OA’s though that are typical leetcode style, but these were not the norm), aside from Spark concepts.

When you scour job postings, you’ll see a company can be entirely on Azure, AWS, Databricks, Snowflake, etc. But I also see a lot of postings that are Airflow, DBT + Snowflake for example. Airflow and DBT are free and you can use a local RDBMS instead of a cloud DW for a project to teach you ETL concepts and data orchestration, warehousing, modeling.

Get good at one stack and apply for jobs that use those. Before your resume gets to a human, an ATS will scan for all the relevant key words in your resume with the JD. I have only worked with Azure & Databricks so I immediately stop reading a JD when it’s asking for AWS or Snowflake. In your resume, emphasize the results per experience (ex. optimized X by Y%) first, responsibilities second. I think you can definitely give your many different roles to chatgpt and ask it to reframe those roles to be more DE-specific.

As for certs, I have noticed consulting roles seem to value those more than product company roles. If you’re fine with spending money, a Databricks DE associate cert, AWS DE, etc could make you stand out more as an entry level candidate. If you want to work with the cloud, AWS is more commonly used over Azure and GCP. Having worked in consulting before, the certs are how the firm pitches you to clients and gets you staffed (and therefore make money off of you).

Lastly, use Linkedin and have all the relevant DE skills and experiences on your profile. It’s a lot easier for recruiters to find you first instead of the other way around.

1qejnn6,5,Man I feel your pain. The situation you described sounds eerily similar to what I walked into at my current job a couple of years back. We had this sprawling CRM system that had been customized over the years by like 5 different consultants none of whom seemed to talk to each other. Marketing was using one set of IDs for customers sales had another and finance was just throwing their hands up in the air. Trying to get a single reliable customer view was a nightmare. We spent weeks just trying to map out the different entities and how they related to each other. It felt like unraveling a giant knotted ball of yarn. And then of course once we thought we had it figured out someone would drop a bomb like Oh yeah that table We stopped using that three years ago but nobody told anyone. The worst part was the constant requests for data pulls. Sales would want a list of customers with X Y and Z marketing needed a segment with A B and C and the data team was stuck writing custom SQL queries all day long. It was completely unsustainable and we never got to work on anything strategic. What finally saved us was this virtual data platform we implemented. The thing that impressed us most was its ability to automatically discover all these hidden relationships between entities that would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. The AI engine identified and resolved data quality issues too duplicate entries mismatched data types the whole nine yards. We didnt have to move or duplicate any data either which was a huge plus for security and compliance. Then once the data was unified we started building no-code ETL processes to push cleansed data to the different systems and to our data warehouse. That part really freed up our data team. Instead of constantly fulfilling ad-hoc requests we could focus on building actual data products and analytics. Seriously the reduction in headaches alone was worth the cost. I know it sounds like Im selling you something here and I kinda am. The company that makes the platform has a referral program and yeah Id get a kickback if you ended up using them. But honestly based on what youve described I genuinely think it could solve your problems. Id be happy to make an introduction if you want to explore it further no pressure either way.

I'm dying for business to wake up and realize why we took time to build data warehouse that actually follow the rules. Those ""let's just do x for now"" always bite you in the ass. It seems today's strategy is to limp things along until the business is fed up enough to wait for an entire redesign. Then the tech team and manager are replaced and you don't even fix all the tech debt because the people aware of it left! Tech debt NEEDS to be tracked and talked about regularly. Where I'm at they pushed anyone technical out of those discussions and it's only been band and worse. The consulting team they brought in pointed the finger at the data/tech team, promoted mid level managers with no tech background into those leadership positions (now they have to lean on the consultants for EVERYTHING AND EVERY DECISION! So much wasted money and time but theres no one technical to explain anything, even WHY things are as messy as they are. 

I saw this happening and tried to get my boss to understand what was happening. Instead he fought her about design differences instead of division of responsibilities. The consultant got 2 years to work with the analysts (who from my outside perspective were much further behind the engineers) while pointing fingers at the engineers/data.

Consume your DEs' entire docs to get ideas or get shadowing sessions. This is what I did to transition, I just reviewed what I already know from experience.

Understand your ETL/ELT pipelines like how data moves from point A to B (from source system up to the analytics layer) in your company. Learn how & why certain tools are being used in the system, their trade-offs in terms of scalability, costs, reliability, their impact, etc. Software engineering plus systems analysis & design concepts help a lot like SDLC & Agile methodologies for example.

If you're proficient with SQL and be able to explain different situations such as knowing when to use subquery vs CTE, view vs materialized view, handling duplicate records, optimizing queries etc. then you're more or less good to go. Knowledge of Python/PySpark helps a lot as well. Understand and differentiate between a data warehouse, data mart, data lake, data lakehouse, dim vs fact tables, normalization vs denormalization, file formats (csv, tsv, parquet, avro), etc. Knowledge of cloud also helps.

1qebb1m,4,"100% agree but in the past 6 months AI agents have really changed how my team and I work.

As I was writing the stuff below I realized it became too long... so here's a summary.

TLDR;  going from first using agents to improve our data pipelines and stack, to eventually creating a more self-service system where our data consumers use AI agents to interact with the data.

  
For some context, I'm leading the DE team of 4-5 people (1 mid/senior, 1 junior, 2-3 interns) at a company where our end product is predictions for highly specialized industries (e.g. renewables, transportation).

At first it started with using our data platform's MCP with cursor to just lookup documentation, then I started asking cursor to read our data pipelines and query the dwh directly to find the specific part of a query or script that was causing some issue.

But in the past couple months, after creating some extensive agent rules/instructions documentations as well as creating a md file for each pipeline that contains some business context, I have been able to fully rely on cursor to build pipelines or make major changes.

A recent example is that I spent \~1 hour creating a details requirements document that I gave as the prompt, the agent make changes to \~10 files (mostly sql models and some yml configs and a python ingestion script). About 3-4 hours of back and forth with the agents to make some adjustments, update documentation, and runs tests and validation. The entire process was done in a single workday, whereas normally this would've been 2-3 days of work.

Its not always about ""saving"" time for me but rather its about doing things the ""better"" way - a clear example of this is having the agents create/update documentation, build/run tests, perform adhoc validations, etc. which translates into time saving in the future

I know what I've said above is not related to ""AI on top of broken data stack"", but the reason why I'm talking about how AI is helping data engineers is because I think it that is the sole reason/contributor to speeding up the process of fixing and improving our data stack.

By fully utilizing the combination of cursor, mcp integrations, internal rules/instructions/context documents, and access to query our data warehouse, we were able to ""slap AI on top of our data"" as in:

\- other teams (i.e. data science, software engineering, product, etc.) to also close our data engineering repos and have conversations with cursor to ask it about the logic behind data models (e.g. does table\_xyz contain data from source\_abc? how often does table\_xyz get updated? what is the calculation method for kpi abc?)

\- integration of an AI Slackbot (provided by our data platform provider) that queries our dwh and returns insights - as a result, we have seen people in data science, sales, execs, etc. move away from using dashboards and instead asking the slackbot directly inside threads things like ""what was our prediction accuracy last week?"" ""how did model A perform vs model B last year?""

I think this only became possible because we were able to quickly (within 2-3 months) clean up our data pipelines and data models, create a lot of documentation and context for AI to utilize, and break down the barrier between data consumers and the data itself - this way as the data engineering team, we are no longer a bottleneck and things have finally trending towards the ""self-service"" utopia we've always dreamt about.",4
1qebb1m,5,"The problem goes even deeper. Traditional software crashes when data is broken, whereas AI tries to make sense of it and smooth over the edges. If you have a fragmented stack with duplicate semantics (e.g. three different definitions of churn\_rate in different tables), the LLM will just pick one randomly or hallucinate an average.

Without a rigid semantic layer or metrics store, deploying GenAI in the enterprise is just an expensive way to generate plausible nonsense",1

I would also get with whoever does the budget modeling / FP&A work for the company as they know the KPIs and drivers of the business, which you will have to align to.  At the end you should have a list of columns or metrics with a domain and column (e.g. domain is customer and columns for account number, name, address, etc).

Then start with that as you talk to other stakeholders.  A good meeting might involve say someone from marketing who knows the views they  want to see, a data analyst who might know what columns/calculations are involved in producing that view and then you and your DA can bump that off against your model.  It's easier to ask them for what's missing rather than come to them with a blank sheet of paper.  Also get a sign off from the department because they will inevitably come back with 20 more requests on the week you drop the finished product.  The DA should be able to work from that artifact.

The data model is important because ideally you want one data source that feeds 80% or more of your data requests.  This ensures that data is consistent across all reporting and dashboards as it uses the same core data and calculations.  If there is an error in a calculation, you can change it in one place and it propagates across all the dependencies.  If you build custom data models for each dashboard or request, then you can have inconsistencies where the developer used the wrong formula, or when you need to make a change you have to find it and change it dozens to hundreds of times.

In terms of important things I would say requirements is first (though you can often do this incrementally), then figuring out your infrastructure.  Like what is your approach to building pipelines and does it provide velocity to develop, is it maintainable, observable, etc.  Does your data platform align well with the likely use cases you know about?  You sort of need this initial planning in place to get going, but afterward you can build incrementally as MVPs or by data subject to show off progress.

You need to balance delivering value and insight to the business with the necessary things to support a robust platform.  Things like automations should be considered, but it's a question of prioritization.  How much time does the automation save vs time to build right now?  Can we defer it without major consequences?  Which ones are the priority?  Can we produce demoable work each sprint or quarter to show progress, and better if the platform can be partially used to deliver value ahead of being fully fleshed out.

1qdya1r,2,"You’re definitely not alone in feeling the pain with Terraform and Iceberg tables—especially when it comes to partitions. It’s a known headache; Terraform’s support for complex Glue table definitions is still lagging, so most teams I know either maintain pretty gnarly workarounds or split things up.

A pattern I’ve seen work well: Use Terraform strictly for the infra “shell” (buckets, Glue databases, IAM, etc.), but let something like dbt or custom scripts handle actual table creation and evolution. Glue jobs with bootstrapping logic (or even AWS SDK/CLI scripts) can generate and update the tables as needed, while the Terraform state stays clean and manageable. It does add an extra step to your deploys, but it’s more transparent and less prone to silent breakage than bending Terraform out of shape.

For versioning, a lot of folks lean on dbt’s schema versions and migration patterns, even if it means treating Glue like more of a catalog pointer than a true source of state.

1qdp2sl,2,"You can use SSMS to get the count of records in each table interactively, from the table properties (right click menu on each table). That doesn't run a count(1), it's getting it from metadata. So it's O(1) time relative to table size. 

Obviously a PITA to do this if you had 100s of tables, but since you only have two tables, dead easy. 

In theory you could query the metadata directly to get this programmatically. It's one of the sys views, but I never remember which.

Other than checking table counts, I guess the important question is how is the server migration being performed? If it's a backup of the old DBs being restored onto the new server, then this is a pretty bombproof approach, so long as:

- writes to the DB have been completely stopped first (e.g. put DB into read only mode first)
- the backup is run with the checksum option

So in this case, I'd focus more on making sure the process for the migration has been thought out fully - then you don't have a lot of validation to do. Otherwise you're just validating that a widely used quarter-century-old enterprise RDBMS doesn't have a certain type of seriously fundamental bug.

If the data migration is happening via some bespoke approach then you do need to validate further. But you first need to ask why they're not doing the more obvious simple backup/restore. 

For further validation, you really need to take the hit on slow scan queries and make sure the time needed for that is built into the migration plan.

Gathering stats is the right approach but I'd focus on sum() of numerical columns that mean something to the business (currency values, quantities, durations, etc). Just sum the whole table with no group by. It doesn't have to be a useful KPI /metric that way, it's just a number that would be very sensitive to anything going wrong in the migration.

You send commands/data through this channel from your application.",1
1qdmier,9,"Every database supports a different network protocol or API to access data.  ODBC and JDBC are Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that specify how a driver can be built for different databases that allows client programs to use the same API on different databases.  The way you send a query, read results, execute statements, etc, then can be the same no matter which database you are using.  This API layer doesn't standardize the query languages you need to use; you still need to send valid SQL commands for the target database, but the code you use to send those queries doesn't need to be specific to the target database.

The difference between ODBC and JDBC is that ODBC is a C-style API and the drivers are platform-specific.  IE you always to build a Linux version and a separate Windows version.  And some ODBC drivers are only available on Windows (where ODBC originated).

JDBC is specific to Java (and other JVM languages like Scala), but a single pure Java (type 4) driver can be used across platforms.

In data engineering JDBC and ODBC are the default, legacy connectors to get to data from various systems.  Both suffer from their heritage as drivers for client/server database systems, and so typically will use a single TCP/IP connection to send queries and read results.  In big data engineering this can be a bottleneck, and so things like native Spark connectors have been built for more scalable data connections to big data systems.",2
1qdmier,10,"For interconnecting databases that are remote to each other and not the same vendor, like connecting Oracle or MSSQL to MySQL.

Another use-case is non-typed languages (not C, C++, C# that requires compiling and binaries), so like JS, Python, PHP, Java, that cannot do direct binary connections to a database, they can only use JDBC or ODBC.

Example, DBeaver is a java based app, and it uses only JDBC to connect to absolutely anything. It's great.

Where I work I use the MySQL v8 ODBC in a Windows server running MSSQL in prod, and push tables across the network truncate/load in a remote staging tables of a MySQL server (that the Wan IP addresses & ports are fixed and whitelisted for security). Once the load is completed, a stored proc is called remotely to signal the MySQL to process those staging tables.

It's an annoying process though, I would rather create flat files, push them somewhere, and an event triggered at the remote end (like a datalake container/folder) processes them. I could then make JSON data and send that, also based on events.

IOW, JDBC/ODBC between servers is a ""work-around"" solution, and it's slow. Like 45 mins to send 2 gigs of data.

Chunking with pandas is a solid approach for memory management, but you do have to be careful: some operations just don’t make sense chunk-by-chunk.

Chunking is great for row-wise, stateless preprocessing (cleanup, type conversion, basic feature engineering). But for anything that needs a full view of the data—global normalization, deduplication, calculating rare category frequencies, finding global min/max—you’ll either need multiple passes or a clever accumulation/aggregation step.

A typical workflow for your scenario:
- First pass: Scan over chunks to gather global stats (means, stds, value counts, rare category thresholds).
- Second pass: Use those stats to transform the data in chunks. Outlier detection, normalization, etc. can be done chunked, but with knowledge of global parameters.
- Save intermediate files as Parquet if possible, for speed and compression.
- Tools: Dask and Polars both handle these kinds of workflows better than vanilla pandas, especially Polars for very fast I/O and multi-threading.
- For Colab: keep an eye on disk (mount Google Drive if needed), and be ready to restart if you hit session limits.

If you ever need to empower less technical folks to safely interact with this data (without risking direct DB access), there are platforms nowadays that let you build internal apps over your datasets via drag-and-drop, or even AI chat interfaces. Could help with democratizing those big data insights beyond just the Python crowd.

That said, to achieve certain title, sometimes you do need to ""wait"" for certain amount of years to pass, unless you are able to **get** & **execute** a wide-scope highly visible project.

As you grow throughout the years and solve more complex problems, inevitably you will encounter new tech stack or rethink your data modeling approach, so you will have organic grow. But more important than arsenal of long list of tech stack is your structured problem-solving skills.

There's two reasons for this. 1) Interviewers know that interviews are stressful. Writing SQL queries on the spot is very difficult and because of that it is not reflective of your actual performance. 2) They know people are going to LLM the answers. This is a very easy way to catch people who dumped the questions into an agent but didn't bother looking at them. They won't be able to explain what the code does, or they'll do it slowly as they look at it for the first time. Either way, easy to catch people.

1qcw5qe,2,"I work as a data modeler and can say this, data models are more needed now than ever. 

Most of the companies build pipelines without models, now they're all facing issues and they don't have backward traceability. Everyone rushed pushing pipelines into production without proper models, processes, conventions and standards in place. Data Modeling is not easy skill to obtain and requires lot of effort, time and multitude skills. 

My current teams uses data vault and dimensional modeling frameworks, it takes time to get to final data marts and views on top but we rarely have pipeline issues (DBT, Snowflake). We spend lot of time upfront, which saves lot of money and reduce development time and effort down the line, which is the right way of doing things. 

When we face any ELT issues, then we go back to the data model and analyze on how to de-couple, optimize the model without breaking the grain at times. It saves lot of load times in some of those big fact tables.  The issues I also noticed and I made those mistakes as well, shove tons of metrics into a fact table and calculate them at the fact table level. Instead those metrics should be calculated at one layer up (business vault or raw vault) layer and just load them as is into fact table. Fact table should be a simple select * from xyz tables. 

There's so many things that can go wrong in a pipeline and data model can solve many of those. We normally do a hands off to our DE's of our data models and mapping docs, it makes their life whole lot easier and efficient at times. ",34
1qcw5qe,3,"It's going to have to make a major comeback. As these companies realize NONE of their metrics (maybe the core metrics are ok) across departments line up. It's like a 10 year cycle, numbers are bad, spend 3-5 years moving towards strict data models and standards. As the business grows and no longer remembers those problems points the finger at slow development, leaders get replaced and the silo/tech debt starts over. 

I'm in the middle of one thats blowing my mind. Working on core metrics that all source from 5-6 dates, calculating the time between timestamps. Instead of defining those 5-6 dates with proper labels we expect the devs to get that same date whenever it's needed for a metric.... This isn't clean data and I could calculate these data points several different ways using different columns to filter. Sure they'll be close but those minor differences have cost companies millions when it distracts from the actual conversation.",16
1qcw5qe,4,"Totes. The idea that we don’t need modelling anymore could only be pushed by people who have no clue what they are on about, or grifters trying to sell you bullshit snake oil. Unfortunately CTOs will lap it up because data modelling takes time and expertise, and therefore money. AI produces superficially easy results that appear reasonable enough on first glance. But AIs don’t actually know anything about your business so they will confidently tell you things that are completely wrong, or which are true but not the correct answer to your question. 

Data modelling is not primarily a technical discipline, it is about extracting human-understandable meaning from what is otherwise just a bunch of ones and zeroes. It requires understanding your business deeply, and understanding what the business cares about and needs to measure.  This meaning is often not directly available in your raw data. You have to translate it for a business user.

Now this is where the AI grifters will tell you “oh sure the AI isn’t great at that now but it’s going to get better with better models”. And sure, it will. But even when you have better models that can more accurately translate the user’s intent into a correct answer, you will still have the problem that each individual user is having a separate conversation with an AI. Bob might ask for revenue figures for last month, the AI asks him how to define revenue and gives him a correct answer based on his definition. Jenny has a separate conversation with the AI and gives a slightly different definition and the AI gives her a correct but DIFFERENT answer. 

So how do you fix this situation and ensure that Bob and Jenny get the exact same answer for revenue? You have to make sure there is a source that has the correctly calculated and verified definition of revenue ready for the AI to use. And what do we call this process? Data modelling!

If anything, data modelling only gets more important in the age of AI. Since in the past when you had highly technical data and BI analysts answering the questions for you, you could rely on them having enough knowledge and expertise to work around the complexities and problems of the data. But in a world where every Bob, Jenny, and Harry with no technical knowledge expects to be able to ask the AI for answers themselves, you better be damn sure that it is working off a highly curated and verified source. ",6
1qcw5qe,5,"I agree with your point, LLMs actually demand more modeling complexity, especially when you are now adding structured data along with parsed documents and metadata. Maybe also coupled with a feature store for model inputs/outputs


It would actually increases the surface area for data modeling. Someone needs to decide how to represent extracted entities, where embeddings live, how to join LLM outputs back to source records, and maintain consistency across all of it.

On a side note, LLM on a kafka queue for analytics sounds like a classic “this type its gonna be different because AI” kind of a take, cannot even imagine how bad its gonna be",6
1qcw5qe,6,"The data hype train seems to be intent on forgetting and reinventing each and every wheel it has. That's because the people on the train want to get somewhere, but the train is owned by a wheel-selling company. This metaphor got away from me, kind of like a runaway train.

1qcw5qe,7,"Great topic to bring up. I share the same feeling that there is this hard push to avoid the problem altogether. 

Yes, let's jump on the datalakehouses, as medallion architecture is the one-size fits all solution. Forget about DWH, analytics, we'll leave the business logic to the visualization anyway. Only later they find out the dashboard slow and useless, metrics are useless but by then it's too late...

  
Every two weeks there is a new tool or concept that is rebranded that the community hypes about, LinkedIn is a primary example of this. Then it dies and people forget about it as something else comes up.",5
1qcw5qe,8,"Facts and dims is really more UX first then for whatever engineering reasons (even though less joins are a performance boost) 

People forget this. In kimball, he always talks about how the models should really cater for the end user and the qns asked

In the advent of AI, this is no different. If you really model well, the AI can easily write queries for common metrics because the base table is well name and understood. Then the rest of the refinement are really a bunch of where clauses ",3
1qcw5qe,9,"Data modeling always has been and always will be important.  It's not just one pattern though, it's sticking with whatever pattern makes sense for your company and ensuring it doesn't end up in a pile of irreconcilable shit.  I don't see a huge reason to do dimensional modeling anymore other than your downstream tools may  like it and it's useful if you have a lot of cross-subject rate calculations that benefit from conformed dimensions.  A lot of businesses don't need that though and are fine with stuff like OBTs and master data and those help them move faster.

I am also skeptical that we are going to see a lot of usefulness with LLMs and data any time soon.  I think AI is very useful as a tool to help build pipelines and tools, but not as much for accessing data right now.  Data models can be massive with lots of tables, columns and semantic descriptions for the content, so you end up flooding the context window and confusing the model (most of which is irrelevant context to the problem).  A lot of the definitions are weird so don't align well with the model's training and people also ask the same question 20 different ways, which can lead to inconsistent answers.  

The way I have seen people trying to make AI systems that work is by slowly building up the model and keeping it small (i.e. not the enterprise model you are used to).  So in the end it can only answer simple questions like ""tell me how much revenue we earned from product X in the last three months"".  Given how much time you spend building and tuning the model until you feel like it works most of the time, isn't it faster to just give them a dashboard with the same capability and better accuracy?  Also the user community is thinking that they will be able to prompt the model to do a deep dive that an analyst would spend a week on and that's just not reality.",3
1qcw5qe,10,"Lol! 

I came from being a controller to being a data analist/scientist to being a n00b data engineer but i can tell you one thing from my domain expertise, data modelling is key for success in any organization that leans heavily on data. 

Biggest issue i see with people just rushing the data from A to B is that they basically construct jungles in where employees end up defining their own version of the truth and thereby undermining a core principle of why you had that warehouse/lakehouse in the first place. Departments will build their own vision on top of the mess you supply them with. I had a discussion lately with a professor ranting how multiple versions of the truth can coexist but believe me, companies just want 1 version. In the end, you don't want to have senior level management have a discussion in a meeting about what a cost center is, what data is correct, on what date FTE stats are calculated for reports and what the source is of all of this (that, in effect, will surge your indirect costs, drop the trust in your solution and eventually have management question why in gods name they hired those engineers).",3

1qct0b0,1,"If you’re comparing it to GCP certs, Snowflake’s path is a lot more structured and gated.

SnowPro Core is the real entry point. Snowflake themselves position it for people with \~6+ months of hands-on use, and it’s explicitly required before you can sit any of the advanced exams. It’s broad but Snowflake-specific: architecture, micro-partitions, cost/performance tradeoffs, security, time travel, data sharing. Not hard conceptually, but very “do you know how Snowflake actually works.”

The advanced certs are role-based rather than general:

* Architect / Admin are very environment and governance-heavy
* Data Engineer is focused on data movement, pipelines, performance tuning
* Analyst / Data Scientist are narrower and more SQL / workflow oriented

They’re aimed at people with \~2 years of real Snowflake experience, and honestly feel more like validation than learning tools.

For recruiter visibility, Core is the one most people recognize. The advanced ones mostly matter once you’re already operating in that role.

My advice: be practical and treat the old stuff like it’s cancer that needs to be cut out.

Don’t try to document the mess you have. Instead build or fix things one piece at a time and document that as you go. Build in parallel, dual run against the old things, and when you know the old tables and batches are redundant, take them out back and shoot them in the head.

Also, forget AI. It knows when I’ve forgotten to close a print statement in my shitty code, but it doesn’t know architecture or systems design.

Honestly I think a lot of people are actually over skilled for the jobs they're doing. Management say 'I want real time' and a data engineer hears 'use Kafka' - but what management actually mean is 'i check this every morning and want it to be up to date' so you could probably get away with orchestrating a batch update every morning.

I've also seen people use pyspark for data that is easily small enough to handle without spark. They just think 'but this is what everyone else is using so I should use it'.

The annoying thing is, if you have good judgement and figure out the most appropriate tech to use, that can get in the way of upskilling if you settle on a simple, cheap but more mundane alternative.

If you want to learn some of the things you listed:
- if you're using snowflake, why not just start using dbt + git to manage your SQL?
- how is data getting into snowflake in the first place? If that looks quite manual at the moment, maybe try setting up airflow to schedule data extraction / load

From there you should be able to design decent overall data models, talk with people in detail about what approach should be taken and point out issues in advance before anything has been coded, at this point you're working as much on people skills as hard technical skills.

hopefully I can give you some inspiration 😉. As always, there are many solutions, so here is one of them:

>using dbt with an orchestrator

Even though the question is more about scheduling, I recommend checking out the [Cosmos open-source project](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) for Apache Airflow. It allows you to easily run your existing dbt Core or dbt Fusion projects as Apache Airflow Dags. Looks something like this:

    basic_cosmos_dag = DbtDag( 
        project_config=ProjectConfig(DBT_ROOT_PATH / ""some_project""), 
        operator_args={ 
            ""install_deps"": True,
            ""full_refresh"": True,
        },
        # ...
        # normal dag parameters 
        schedule=""@daily""
        # ...
    )

Based on your model, you then have a very nice Dag, with task groups and individual tasks all visible in the Airflow UI.

>reliably finish before that time detect and alert when things are late

Since Airflow 3.1, you have deadline alerts, which officially replace SLAs. They are quite flexible, let me illustrate an example:

Say your pipeline is scheduled to run at 08:00 am daily. It is queued a little later, say at 08:02 am and you expect it to run no longer than 20 minutes. If it runs longer than 20 minutes, you want to be alerted via Slack.

In this scenario, you take the schedule time of the pipeline as your `reference` (so 08:02 am) and your `interval` is 20 minutes. Which means the deadline is at 08:22 am:

    |------|-----------|---------|-----------|--------|
        Scheduled    Queued    Started    Deadline
         08:00       08:02      08:03      08:22

Within your implementation, this is how to define this deadline alert:

    deadline_alert = DeadlineAlert(
        reference=DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_QUEUED_AT,
        interval=timedelta(minutes=15),
        callback=AsyncCallback(
            SlackWebhookNotifier,
            kwargs={
                ""text"": ""{{ dag_run.dag_id }} missed deadline at {{ deadline.deadline_time }}""
            },
    )
    
    @dag(
        deadline=deadline_alert
    )
    def your_dag():
        # ...

You can also use `DeadlineReference.DAGRUN_LOGICAL_DATE` as a reference, which represents the scheduled date (so in our case 08:00 am).

Or, let's say you must be finished at a specific time per day, you can do something like:

    tomorrow_at_ten = datetime.combine(datetime.now().date() + timedelta(days=1), time(10, 0))
    
    deadline_alert = DeadlineAlert(
        reference=DeadlineReference.FIXED_DATETIME(tomorrow_at_ten),
        ...

Since you have full freedom in the callback, you can use any kind of notification.

And of course, you can combine that with the `DbtDag` from Cosmos 😉.

While deadline alerts may work well in some scenarios, many cases require more advanced observability. If you are open to a managed solution, Astronomer offers Astro Observe. It allows you to define and monitor SLAs without code changes and supports root cause analysis, lineage, impact analysis, and more. You can also connect a self-hosted OSS Airflow environment by enabling OpenLineage with a single configuration change.

Apart from that, Airflow also supports sending metrics to [StatsD or OpenTelemetry](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/administration-and-deployment/logging-monitoring/metrics.html), which includes Dag runtimes. In a previous job, I used this to monitor Dag runtimes via Grafana and have alerting on that level.

Again, many ways to approach this.

>manage dependencies

If you use Cosmos, you already have the dependencies within your Dag derived from your model definition. However, if we talk about dependencies between Dags (pipelines), Airflow has various ways to solve this.

You can use implicit time-based dependencies, by simply using time-based scheduling in a way, that the downstream pipeline runs after the pipeline, yet, this is the worst solution.

You can also use an `ExternalTaskSensor` that waits for the completion of a pipeline or task. Since Airflow 3, this also supports a deferred mode, so by using `deferrable=True` it will run async by the triggerer component without using any worker slot, in case you need to wait a bit longer 😅.

But the new way to solve this are data assets, introduced with Airflow 3.0. Assets are datasets, which have been there since Airflow 2.4, but renamed, enhanced and more integrated.

The idea is simple: in the upstream pipeline you define one or more asset outlets, and in your downstream pipeline you set the schedule not to be a cron expression, but to be an asset:

    @dag(
        schedule=Asset(""daily_sales"")
    )
    def monthly_report():
        # ...

Assets also support logical expressions and they have their own view in the Airflow UI, which is nice 😁.

There is also a shortcut to create a Dag, with a single Python task and an asset as an outlet, which is by using the `@asset` decorator.

>Is the usual solution just scheduling earlier with a buffer, or is there a more robust approach

Python to gather API - 100% - but the way you do it, that data with that format at that time is lost forever.

Python with API to a Datalake container, one folder per source, and subfolder per source API name. Store as JSON. Why? For SSoT and what if the supplier of that API goes out of business, changes their API in some way, that breaks your code? What if in your dataframe the tuple you extract as a table, you're not pulling all entites or all columns - then the business wants you to add those extra columns, retroactively from Day 1 you've been gathering. You're screwed - you don't have it anymore.

So E-L-T. Extract (Python + API), Load (into storage for 100% retrieval of 100% of that data), Transform (into a Staging layer, dedupe, business rule(s) for ingestion UpSert or Rejection, into the Bronze layer.

So Bronze has proper types and only valid data, Bronze can be destroyed (for a particular source) and recreated at any point in time in the future by rereading all the data in the Datalake and redoing the L & T of the ELT. 

Staging is usually truncate/load style, and uses Datalake functionality for ingestion - Python isn't needed here at all. Python only for reading from APIs and other distant sources, not for moving data around in the database.

Python has another function - for ML - where Python does extensive transformations by reading Bronze & Silver (or even the raw Datalake data) to ""invent"" new data that is then fed back into a Staging layer.  For example, a customer ""rating"" based on criteria that can span multiple source systems for that customer.",8

1qbq2eg,1,"Biggest lesson from teams that’ve shipped this: text to SQL isn’t the hard part, trust is. A few design things that usually matter more than model choicee would be like always ground generation on the actual schema + metrics layer, not just table names. Most failures come from the model guessing joins or columns, Add a validation step before execution (dry run, limits, blocked queries). Don’t let raw generated SQL hit prod blindly. Start narrow, Constrain what users can ask for (time ranges, metrics, dimensions) before going fully “chatty”. On the knowledge side, most teams I’ve seen keep it simple, Use RAG for business logic, definitions, metric semantics,Treat schema and relationships as structured input, not embeddings.GraphRAG helps when relationships are complex, but it adds a lot of operational overhead.Solr *can* work for retrieval, but it’s usually better as a search layer than a true graph store. If relationships matter a lot, a dedicated graph or just explicit schema metadata often ends up clearer and more reliable. and correctness and guardrails beat clever architecture early.

1qbq2eg,2,"I would spoon-feed a private LLM specific queries for specific use-cases, going from simple to more complex, and make it pick & choose, not invent SQL code from scratch.

What if my company’s fiscal year begins in March and ends on last day of Feb? That’s business knowledge that your solution needs. 

Full disclosure: I work at Databricks, and since you mentioned Azure in another comment.. just reminding that Azure Databricks is a first party PaaS offering in Azure. I have helped many customers with this problem and truly believe that what Databricks gives is a high quality text2sql solution with AIBI Genie. You can find lot of information on Databricks Genie and its benchmarking results.

Its a hard problem to solve especially around the biggest requirement which I see from analysts or power users, which is the need for quality and deterministic SQL code. This is where traditional BI does well, whereas LLMs could hallucinate.

Best practices in Genie include using well curated metadata about each dataset, column definitions,  semantic understanding about the data etc. These become non negotiable with agent based solution, since that's the only context for AI.

Something like Genie being a tool in your arsenal will help your overall agentic solution. And best part is that you don't need data to be in Databricks. Databricks can connect into your database via Lakehouse federation and understand the layout of data.",1

So the thinking becomes things like where this pipeline will actually break, what happens when volume doubles, what can fail safely and what cannot, and what’s expensive to recompute versus cheap to store. If you’re not on a DE project right now, the closest substitute is to simulate real pain. Take a public dataset and design ingestion, transformations, and reporting, then deliberately change assumptions like schema changes, late arriving data, backfills, or higher volume, and force yourself to optimize for cost and reliability instead of elegance. Books and blogs help with vocabulary, but most architectural thinking comes from asking what the simplest thing is that won’t hurt you later, then being wrong a few times. Reading postmortems and migration stories taught me more than polished tutorials ever did.

There might be other tools (BI tools, proxies, etc) that have built in support for more popular platforms that won't work with MotherDuck out the box. None of these are particularly insurmountable, just costs you should be happy to take on in exchange for the experience you like. 



One thing you might do to hedge is store data at rest in Iceberg on GCS and self host a catalog like \[Lakekeeper\](https://docs.lakekeeper.io/). Then your data is completely portable. If you for some reason determine you need to switch to Snowflake or Databricks, they can read data form this catalog and you don't have to move anything.

Not necessarily, its either you use Motherduck as you are or you spin up some containers on GCP and manage the compute engine for duckdb and catalog on your own with ducklake.  It is not a super complicated stack but it *is* work and creates an additional point of failure, especially with the networking and security side of it imo.

When you google their past company it will show some dummy website and no location for company or either some incorrect location pointed as company office.

This is not external hiring this is scenario in internal project interview of mnc big one like infy tcs …",33
1qaoqlz,7,"Had a similar experience late last year. Some candidates tried inviting an AI ""note taker"" to the Teams call, that was denied access and was an immediate red flag (not one of them \*asked\* if they could do so).

We then had people who seemed to hesitate before answering any question. Once or twice, nerves, every single question? It's pointing the way of stalling before waiting to see the text appear for them to regurgitate! There's also the tell of the eye darting off screen to read something... could be notes, but... given what they then said, it just gave the impression of reading from either someone else googling on their behalf, or AI LLM output.

But every single one was derailed by this one simple trick... as hiring manager, I was interviewing the person for them, not their technical skills. There was some of that, but more in approach and mentality, rather than specific abilities, that would come in the next round. So I would just say to the candidate ""You have listed these ETL tools on your CV, which is your favourite and why?""

Every single time, the ones reading AI output would turn into a marketing bot, sounding like an advert for the tools, bullet point after bullet point. Not one of them highlighted a favourite without being asked again, and then couldn't actually answer definitively as to why they chose that above another, almost as if they'd just picked one at random. The humans answering that question would do so in a conversational manner, often immediately blurting out their favourite and then going through the pros and cons as to why.

I can see the appeal of using AI to help, to act as a pointer to guide your answers, especially in areas of theory where you're rusty because you've been at the coalface for a while. But don't rely on it 100% to the point where you cannot actually hold a conversation with the person you're talking to.",15

Merge should be pretty efficient. You can even land the data in a full append table option c and then do option b. You can set up a small job to clear out older data in the append table periodically. This might be nice just to give you better visibility into the data and make sure your process is working as expected.",2

There is 0 gain from making it a snapshot and eating the storage and eventually processing speed. I wouldn't worry too much about what others think of how and where the data should work in theory. Theory rarely ever applies in the real world, the data and how you get it dictates what you do and in this field most cases, you have 0 control over the source of the data. Which means almost nothing operates like it should and you just have to get the data as accurate as possible, as efficiently as possible space, and processing wise.

  
To me, Bronze always matches source, or at least as close to it as you can possibly get. If it doesn't, you are going to have a horrible time running down why things don't match up. Snapshotting like option A is really only good for if you need to see how things have changed over time, or doing day to day comparisons at the Bronze level and I'd rarely ever want to do that because that's honestly a waste of space and processing. 

  
As for Option C, I would avoid anything that makes data right after the fact and there's a point in time where non-dirty read data is inaccurate. That's asking for someone or something to query it when it isn't fixed yet and you running down nonsense for a day.",2

What usually works in practice is breaking this into stages. First chunk aggressively not just by tokens but by semantic boundaries like sections or topics, otherwise reasoning quality falls off anyway. Then do cheap filtering or summarisation passes first, either with a smaller model or heuristics, to identify which chunks are even worth turning into Q&A. Only send the “interesting” chunks to a large model

For cost people often mix models like small or mid size models for chunking, summarising, and question generation, then a stronger model only for refining or validating a much smaller subset. Trying to run LLaMA-3 70B end to end on a million long documents will blow your budget no matter the platform

I work in cybersecurity and often do the work you're describing.  And yeah, it's fun.  Even though you say these are one-off parsing datasets in my experience there's still a huge need for:

   * writing code to handle a lot of backfilling - go pull 20 years of whois data in daily csv files...
   * building *tested* library modules to do common things - log record counts at each step along with reject counts by reason to a common table that can be used for audit reporting - and that you go back to when people are using the data later & have questions.
   * rerunning the parsing *numerous* times until everyone is satisfied - on things like whether or not which fields get url-decoded, what to do about fields that were decoded or encoded multiple times, fixing fields with multiple timestamp formats, etc.  Recently we had to do this with a nasty vendor feed - and ended up writing code to loop through about two dozen timestamp format attempts until one worked - for every record.

If you spent a few years doing this and wanted to go back to engineering and interviewed with my team and then told us that you thought the work would be fun, and you learned a lot, we would have no problem with that.

You can get away with more (for better or worse, you’re pushing massive scalability problems down the road but if they will never happen in your use case then it’s perfect.)

The biggest issue with Polars is that’s it’s relatively new, and there is potential for more breaking changes across future releases. That’s part of growing pains. If you’re in  a company with standards and need to prioritize long term stability, then that’s another scenario. But things move so fast. Dbt and Duck would still evolve in 10 years.

1q9ylqb,8,"Some additional considerations which I have not seen yet:


- For easy transformations, single node spark is outperformed by both duckdb and polars. However, IME for very complicated jobs, the catalyst query optimizer behind Spark performs better than the other two - if you have more than 10ish non-broadcast joins in a given query, I would rather trust spark. You will need to spend more time on a dev setup (e.g. unit tests are awfully slow without a spark connect server which you fire up each morning), but you also get some goodies such as Spark UI/History Server and a really powerful and stable API.


- As you are using Delta, I would be cautious with duckdb. Afaict, write support is not yet there, and even for reads I had undocumented not-implemented errors bubble up from the internal c++ code (on1.41 if I remember correctly). The API there does not yet look super stable.


- On the off chance that you are in a corporate environment where your development machines run windows, strongly prefer polars over spark. Delta spark on windows is possible but a pain because of the Hadoop dependency.",4

Then a staging area (schema) that links to the landing area and allows hashing to eliminate dupes. No transformations here. All columns varchar. A reject schema for data that cannot fit into bronze due to an error. 

Then Medallion architecture for schemas bronze, silver, gold. 

Bronze (column transformations to correct types) from the staging. Any data rows that do not conform go to reject schema. Also Bronze is a great place for SCD2 tables. 

Silver is new & inferred data that is valid but doesn’t exist in bronze. Like splitting customers by geographical zones based on their address. It can make sense for some silver tables to be SCD2, but that’s rare. 

For geolocation you go get another single source of truth, stage it and bronze it. Then the silver combines two different bronze tables. The silver geolocation could be scd2 for tracking the moves that PK did. And so on. To meet all Gold requirements, for dimensions and facts.  

Gold is dimensional tables that Kimball and Snowflake are famous for. DIM and FACT. 

Using Airflow for pushing the data in the Medallion layers is standard practice. 

To go from BigQuery directly to Snowflake FACT, this is called a Proof Of Concept. Nothing wrong with that. Suggestion, put it in a Dev environment and build a Prod environment. 

Dev & Prod (maybe UAT eventually) can simply be different database names, same Snowflake account, same Datalake account. 

You do NOT want the PowerBI people doing their own “fill in the blanks“ that’s how you get data silos. They Will Do This !!!

For example (true life example) the PowerBI people will go get their own geolocation data from god knows where and make mistakes, so that Sales Dept will have X$ in one zone and Finance Dept will have Y$ in the same zone for the same time period, as each Dept will have a different PowerBI person. 

Data must be centralized. For SSoT to work, and in every data row identity the source system for each PK. Maybe as part of your naming convention for the column. 

Don’t be afraid of typing long column names. Use acronyms when it makes sense. 

If you haven’t already, take an online course on Medallion and Kimball architecture.",2
1q92eti,2,"u’re running into the “founder says compliance” problem with zero policy attached. Before you redesign everything, force one clarity step: what exact requirement are we following? (“EU data must stay in EU”, “India must stay in India”, etc.). “Each country in its own region” is usually not the real rule, it’s the vibe.

If data residency is actually required, then yeah: you can’t do Firebase → Bq → Snowflake US for everyone and call it compliant. The sane pattern is raw + PII stays in-region, and only aggregated/anonymous data can move cross-region (if allowed). Practically that means separate regional stacks (EU BigQuery dataset + EU Snowflake / or whatever) and your Airflow just orchestrates per-region configs. 

Start with 2 regions (EU + US), keep schemas identical, and create a “global” layer that’s aggregates only. Biggest footgun is mixing PII across borders and hoping to “fix later”, get the rule written down first, then architect.",1
1q92eti,3,"Man, I feel your pain. Being the only data person at a startup is a trial by fire. Your founder is right to be concerned about regional compliance, it's a huge headache waiting to happen if you don't address it early. We had a similar situation at my company. We're a SaaS platform, and we started getting customers in the EU and APAC. Suddenly, we had to deal with GDPR, various data residency requirements, and a whole bunch of other fun stuff. Our initial setup was a mess data scattered across different databases and cloud services, no clear understanding of which customer data resided where, and absolutely zero auditability. It was a compliance nightmare. The initial thought was S3 and Iceberg like your mentor mentioned. That adds a ton of complexity in terms of infrastructure and data management. Imagine having to manage multiple S3 buckets and Iceberg catalogs, one for each region? Plus, you'd still need compute instances for processing, potentially Snowflake instances per region as you mentioned. The operational overhead alone would be insane, not to mention the cost. What we ultimately did was implement a virtual data platform that sits on top of our existing infrastructure. It basically created a unified view of all our data, regardless of where it was physically stored. The really cool part was that it automatically discovered relationships between different datasets and identified Personally Identifiable Information (PII). It even flagged data quality issues, like duplicate customer records with slightly different spellings. This would have taken us weeks to untangle manually. Once we had that unified view, we could easily define data policies based on region. So, for example, any data tagged as EU customer data automatically adheres to our GDPR compliance rules. The platform also provides a complete audit trail, so we can easily prove to regulators that we're compliant. And here's the thing that really saved our bacon: we built automated data pipelines using a no-code interface on top of all of this. Before, marketing and sales were constantly bugging the data team to pull reports, create custom dashboards, and integrate data from different sources. It was a huge time sink. Now, they can do most of that themselves with the no-code tools, freeing up the data team to focus on more strategic projects. It sounds like you are running into very similar problems. The company we used has a referral program, so I'm happy to connect you. Full disclosure, I get a little something if they end up helping you out. But honestly, it was such a game-changer for us that I'd recommend them even if I wasn't getting a kickback. They really helped us get our data under control and avoid a major compliance disaster. Happy to make an intro if you think it could be a fit.",1
1q9016g,1,Word of warning on airbyte. They seem okay for small amounts of data but once you get to any kind of scale the wheels fall off. You also need to implement row checking QA and sampling between source and destination as sometimes airbytes replication actually fails but shows success.,7
1q9016g,2,"save your raw data on gcs first, then load it to bigquery, much cheaper",6
1q9016g,3,"This stack is pretty sane for your priorities. Bq is a good fit at 150k orders/yr if you’re disciplined about partitioning/retention and don’t let Looker queries go wild, and Airbyte→BQ is a common pattern. Two quick pushes though: I wouldn’t drop line items entirely (you’ll want them for margin/returns/cohort/LTV and subscription analysis), but you can keep them in a separate table/partition and only join when needed; and I’d strongly consider adding a lightweight transform layer (dbt or even scheduled SQL) so your “business tables” (orders, customers, subscriptions, spend) are stable and not raw connector schemas.

For costs/lock-in: biggest surprise costs are usually (1) Looker exploring raw wide tables, (2) GA event data blowing up, and (3) Airbyte sync volume if you pull too much too often. oh yeah also get budgets/alerts in GCP day 1, partition/cluster core tables, and create curated views for Looker so analysts aren’t querying raw. Also, if you ever want less lock-in later, keeping transforms in dbt + storing raw exports (GCS) makes migrating much easier than relying on tool-specific modeling.",4
1q9016g,4,"Your tech stack is very sane. People have provided good feedback in terms of keeping your low level grain data.


Don't hot load into bigquery but rely on external tables through Google cloud storage. We ran dbt core as a service in a docker container being hosted if you want to go through that route. If you want to keep it low maintenance, Google dataform which is their equivalent transformation platform is good enough for your needs most likely and one less thing to maintain. 


We were processing more data than you and we were running maybe less than 100 dollars a month in terms of GCP billing for a very similar stack (marketing analytics purposes), including Airbyte.


If you want someone to bounce ideas more deeply, happy to discuss.",4
1q9016g,5,"I mean, it will work well and I think you know that. LookML will lock you in to Google if you’re not careful but I’m not sure how much that should matter. Like you said about Airbyte, use it to stand analytics up then start looking at an OSS stack like boring semantic layer + Superset if more obvious risks start to surface. Definitely not a higher priority than getting OSS Airbyte going. Clickhouse or StarRocks are probably good off ramps from BigQuery if you want to eventually stop renting all together in the future.",3
1q9016g,6,"Seems like you have everything quite pieced out. You mention you want to use Airbyte for ingestion, but what about transformations? Certainly depends on the idea that you have for the analytics, but i think you'd easily be also in the free tier of dbtCloud. Similarly to airbyte, quite easy to move to self hosted if you need more.",3
1q9016g,7,I like the DE stack for Ecom use case. My niche is ecom and logistics and I find most ecom teams use Google so Big Query is a solid option. It also is GA4 friendly which is a big plus. GCP has many other data tools if you ever need to scale up at some point (but can get costly if you don't have someone monitoring or have one bad query). Looker does the trick and again most Ecom / digital teams use this so easy sell internally. In terms of ETL I just go for Fivetran if the customer doesn't have an interanl DE team or a savvy analyst. Can get a bit pricey though. Landing the data into Google storage and then transform from there. I find a little bit of Python goes along way in the DIY DE space as well!,2

1q8zg1d,2,"Once you learn one data stack, the rest become much easier. It’s like your first programming language, hard at first, but after that, new languages (or tools) are mostly syntax and platform differences.

In data engineering, the core problems never change:

* Where is the data stored?
* Where does compute run?
* How do I move data or compute efficiently?
* How do I model and serve the data?

Whether it’s Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, or Spark-on-whatever, you’re solving the same underlying problems with different interfaces. Many “new” platforms are abstractions over familiar engines (Spark) anyway.

Most content creators aren’t learning everything from scratch each time; they’re reapplying the same approach to new tools. Once you’ve done that a few times, picking up a new stack is a breeze. 

Also, free tiers and cheap cloud setups make experimentation easy. You don't have to break your bank to spin up a Spark cluster.

Sharding is driven by access patterns, not just structure. A practical approach is to discover candidates at runtime: inspect PKs, unique keys, and FKs, then observe which columns actually appear in point-query predicates (where, join on, partition by clauses). Use those signals to score candidate keys. Tables can be co-located only when they share a common columns. If a query doesn’t include a routable key, reject it rather than scatter-gather.

1q8ble3,1,"Disclaimer: I work for LanceDB, and I wrote most of its catalog integrations. Someone saw this post and sent to me so here I am writing my first Reddit reply lol

Lance does support most of the catalog on the market, check out this page: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/integrations/) I guess I did a bad job marketing these features. I did publish a few blogs, but mostly under the context of integration with compute engines, like [https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/](https://lancedb.com/blog/introducing-lance-namespace-spark-integration/) and [https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/](https://lancedb.com/blog/lance-namespace-lancedb-and-ray/) . For all the supported catalogs, you can basically use Lance side by side with your Iceberg datasets.

But I think you raised a great question - ""anyone actually cataloging their lance datasets? or is everyone just yolo-ing it"". I did these integrations because we do have real customers using them. But I do see a common trend that data engineers in enterprise corporations that have data lake, data warehouse or data lakehouse setups, and trying to integrate Lance for AI features tend to want catalog support. For the frontier labs AI engineers, they tend to just prefer having storage-only solution and yolo-ing it.

To bridge that gap, I also did one catalog within Lance, the Directory Namespace: [https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/](https://lance.org/format/namespace/dir/catalog-spec/) . It is basically a catalog living in a directory, backed by a Lance table, so everything still stays purely in storage. It is also compatible with just a plain directory of Lance tables, which is typically how people start using lance format, when they do pip install lancedb and create a table. 

In general, most of the users I interact with treat embedding as a part of real data assets. You can definitely store multiple versions of embeddings generated by different models for different use cases or just compare their effectiveness and switch over time. That is actually one key use case for Lance, which is you start with a table with just a single column, maybe images or videos. You continue to do data evolution - add embedding columns, caption columns, feature columns over time, and they accumulate and become a very wide table. That becomes your entire multimodal data asset. Check out some case studies with for example Netflix [https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/](https://lancedb.com/blog/case-study-netflix/), Runway: [https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com/talks/2025-data-council/)",10

Snowflake (SF) would probably be much easier to learn as SF is more of a SQL-first paradigm; I'd recommend learning **Iceberg** in parallel to SF.

Maybe look into experimenting with real time streaming solutions as well like (Kafka / SQS) + (Spark Streaming / Flink / Golang) to stream table changes (CDC) from an RDBMS (e.g. Postgres) into an Iceberg table that could be queried via Snowflake.

Also be sure to know when to use a row-based file format (e.g. Avro) and when to use column-based format (e.g. Parquet).

1q89cew,3,"Had this exact naming debate when I consolidated three separate orchestration systems last year.

Honestly the term depends on what you want to communicate:

""Job Control Framework"" or ""Job Control Tables"" is the most established. Goes back to mainframe batch processing. If your metadata drives what runs and when, this fits.

""Pipeline Metadata Store"" is more modern, emphasizes you're tracking pipeline state rather than just ""jobs."" Works well if you're in a dbt/Airflow world.

""Orchestration Control Tables"" if you want to be explicit that this layer is decoupled from your actual data models.

""Run Manifest"" is borrowed from dbt. Better if your metadata is more about ""what happened"" (observability) vs ""what should happen"" (control).

I'd skip anything with ""connector"" unless it's actually handling source system connections. That term is overloaded now, half the modern data stack thinks connector = Fivetran/Airbyte-style ingestion.

Quick side note: if you're manually querying these tables at job start to figure out dependencies and last-run timestamps, might be worth checking if your orchestrator exposes that natively through its metadata DB or API.

1q81qwi,3,"I guess you have a data warehouse under the hood. If that’s the case, I’m increasingly recommending to materialise results NOT on the warehouse, but on an iceberg table, possibly with a REST catalog that allow for git-like management and branching (e.g. Nessie). 

This way, you remove versioning issues from the map (just use iceberg and catalog’s versioning features and best practices)

For table data access, you can use the iceberg table as external table in your data warehouse (ok if you have infrequent access or if it’s ok to have a bit of latency) or load the latest version of data in bulk (replacing the existing table) on a single work table on the warehouse if you need high availability or low latency for reads through the warehouse 

That said, there are 100s of variants and approaches :) if you have some specific needs just drop some more info on your need and stack, I think a lot of people may be able to help",1
1q81qwi,4,"I assume the users of your model will care that improvements are made, but probably not care for the specific knowledge that they are using ""v1.0"" or ""v1.1"" of the model.  I assume *you* guys care what version is in the wild, same as any need for source control.

  
Depends what you're using, I guess.  As u/chronic4you  said, if you're using Delta Lake then versioning and metadata is part of it.  I can't comment on Iceberg, we don't use it.  We do use Delta Lake, and in my case, we wouldn't have differently-named versions knocking around in terms of production.  They just get replaced.  But we don't run parallel releases and stuff like that.  For capturing version metadata in Delta Lake, you could use custom commit messages when altering/replacing tables.

  
This is kind of something I've been thinking about a bit, too.  The potential for drift between the DDL code that *is* source controlled and the object in the catalog that the DDL defines concerns me.  I don't really have a solution.



If you're using simple SQL tables for example, good luck to you.  Times past I've had various permutations of ""x\_dev"", ""x\_revision"", ""x\_update"", and even ""x\_new"" sitting in the database alongside the proper table.  Good times.",1

Maintaining an change feed table is also useful to recreate older ones which you have deprecated.",2

1q7sc09,2,"I have made this kind of transition from analytics to data engineering, so here's my 2 cents:

I'd say Designing Data-Intensive Applications would be a good book if you really want to learn some foundational stuff, especially if you already have somewhat of a comp sci background. I don't think this information is really a hard requirement for getting started though.

Data engineering is just so incredibly broad. So much of your day to day job is dictated by what size company you end up applying at as well as the industry. For example, Kafka is a foundational piece of tech for a high percentage (forget the actual number) of fortune 500 companies. But it's also totally overkill for many smaller companies who may not need near-real-time analytics or near-real-time data processing.

I'd say to become very comfortable with SQL (postgres and one data warehousing dialect such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery), Python, and dbt. While some may classify dbt as an ""Analytics Engineer"" tool, I think it's a great bridge between the worlds of data analyst and data engineering. Plus it's very common at companies of many different sizes.

Then become comfortable with some form of orchestration tool such as Airflow, Prefect, Dagster, or some equivalent of those. For Airflow, there is a MWAA local runner docker image that might be useful for running a local version of Amazon's managed Airflow instance. Just search ""github MWAA local runner"" to find the repo which should have instructions. This is way easier and cheaper than running a real airflow instance.

Maybe just read up on data ingestion tooling such as Airbyte, Fivetran, or Meltano, just to fill in that gap so you understand how transactional data gets loaded into a data warehouse (ELT is a good term to know/research).

At that point, I'd say the knowledge you've acquired is transferrable to most tools that small to mid-sized companies would require (or at least desire) for an entry level data engineer position.

Good luck!",10

1q793r0,1,"What usually works in production: (1) broadcast the small tables explicitly when possible, (2) join biggest tables last if they aren’t small, (3) consider combining small tables into one wide table before joining, and (4) persist only when you absolutely need to reuse intermediate results. Tools like dataflint can also help visualize join plans and spot performance bottlenecks before they become painful.",29
1q793r0,2,"Many joins are fine, if your job is otherwise reasonably sized (right amount of compute for your data), common performance culprits are data skew and nulls in join keys (subset of data skew really). 

Check the UI to see if you have any straggling executors. Most tasks should take seconds or less. For highly skewed data you will see one or more executors taking much longer on join steps. Fix can be identifying skewed keys and splitting them off to broadcast instead or salting before joining to evenly distribute.",10
1q793r0,3,"This depends a bit on what you're actually joining. How big (in GB) is your data? What about the distribution of your join keys? Are some of your joins skewed? Are there null values in your join keys (this is usually a problem that causes a lot of skew and performance issues)? How much data are you joining per row, as in what is the content of the columns you're joining (if this is big this also causes problems)? Are you increasing the number of rows with these joins? Also, what is actually failing when it does? Try to see what's going on using the Spark UI while it's running to see what's taking so long, or what's going wrong.

I think repartitions and partitions will mess up your performance. Repartitions will be pointless because I think Spark will reshuffle with the next join anyway, and persists make it more difficult for Spark to optimize the entire plan and may take up space on memory / disk, which you may already be lacking.

If column renaming seems to mess up your execution plan try to do all of the column remaining before the joins (so rename columns for each dataset first) and/or do all the renaming at the end. I don't see how your action plan would result in anything other than a bunch of BroadcastHashJoins with no shuffling in between this way, given all of the joins are joining small tables to a large table on the same unique ID.

Also check how much memory each executor is using and how the data is distributed across your workers. If your data doesn't fit in your cluster's memory it will become very slow either way.

All that said, if you're doing 27 joins on 820k rows with max 64 cores it might just take a long time either way. That's a lot of work and a big plan to distribute for very little cores.",4
1q793r0,4,"It's tough to diagnose without looking at the UI / Plan. As others mentioned, you likely have skewed keys with that many joins. Check the explain plan and try to simplify wherever possible, even if it means caching or writing intermediate results to disk,",3
1q793r0,5,Not sure this is the answer you are looking for but this is small data. Does it need spark? Can this be done in SQL or in a distributed fashion? Why add complexity?,3
1q793r0,6,"

The main flaw in a 27 join pipeline is not the number of tables. It is that each join adds complexity to the plan and expands the shuffle graph. Even if each side is small, Spark’s optimizer might not treat it that way. Tools like AQE exist to reshape joins dynamically, but in practice they are not always enough, especially if Spark does not recognize your joins as equi joins.

What changed the game for us was three things combined:

* Using explicit broadcast hints instead of letting Spark guess, for example `broadcast(df_small)` Forces a BroadcastHashJoin rather than a nested loop join.
* Reducing the logical plan spike by collapsing intermediate transformations. This means fewer repeated `.withColumn()` calls.
* Using DataFlint’s plan diff tooling to see where broadcast dropped out. That exposed the real culprit.

You can tune memory, partitions, and caching, but none of that matters if the plan never selects an efficient join algorithm.",4
1q793r0,7,"Add \`checkpoint()\` or \`localCheckpoint()\` and it will be as fast as you expected. The bottleneck here are not executors memory or shuffle or cluster size. Most probably the bottleneck here is a driver and a growing lineage of the spark's execution graph.

From the \`checkpoint\` documentation you can see that this mechanics is specifically for your case:

>Returns a checkpointed version of this `DataFrame`. Checkpointing can be used to truncate the logical plan of this `DataFrame`, which is especially useful in iterative algorithms where the plan may grow exponentially.

There's a creative tension there that needs some judgement to negotiate, and sometimes, there'll be a shift or some contextual thing that changes that means suddenly it's time to tweak your implementation model again. You need some freedom to be able to do that - but it should be constrained - go too far off-piste and nobody will understand what you're up to.

Back to the question, if you've got multiple dev streams working in the same area, it pays to have a canonical representation that they can all agree on (whether they're human or machine) to support data-sharing and integration later on - therefore, there has to be some design-first approach to data - at least at some level.

1q70p8d,1,"Im 100% remote but am an exception in my company.  Sort of got grandfathered in.  my work is project based so as long as deliverables get delivered, management is happy.  it’s expected that I’m generally available throughout the day and for meetings but I can run errands, meal prep or get out for a run.

The other side of it is my work means that I’m on call 100% of the time.  any overnight processing failures hit me first.  

working remote means that Im probably not first in line for promotions or advancement but I’m fine with that since the pay is good -  I’m earning large city wages and living in a small college town.  I’m even more than fine with it because I enjoy my work and love my flexability",46
1q70p8d,2,"If I’m going to be away from my desk for anything, including picking a kid up from school, it’s on my work calendar so everyone is aware. Surprise meetings happen. I’ve had the CTO ask me to hop on a call as the call was starting.

1q70p8d,3,"I’m a hundred percent remote, my flexibility working hours are normal 9-5 no on call, I have meetings maybe 2-3 times a week check in with director team meeting, progress check in, to be honest I only “work” like 2-3 hours a day and I just watch tv while I await progress updates, pretty low stress I love it",17

Anything else you’d probably have to ask the manager, find a relaxed role, or earn through hard work.

Meetings are meetings, it’s probably somewhat more though because there’s not organic opportunities to interact with people so video meetings are about it.

So to directly answer your last point. That desire is probably not going to fly and you’ll be unlikely to land a role if you flat out say that. Unless you are in a way different time zone than the company",12

I have core hours which I need to work with a bit of flexibility baked in.  1 or 2 hours either side of core hours if I have tasks to do during the day e.g. go to the dentist.

>I generally much prefer working in the evenings and spending my day doing what I want.

Very unlikely to happen for the reasons above.  Remote is often misunderstood as ""work anywhere at any time"".  Remote more accurately is rephrased as ""work from anywhere within the country you have working rights during specific hours which have been stipulated in a contract"".

You also have the situation where if you work in the evening and there's nobody there with you, there's a strong possibility you're doing fuck all/maverick shit which is about to murder production tomorrow and there's nobody there to help.

That being said, no harm in asking.  You have to be okay with accepting this is really unlikely though.",9

1q70p8d,8,"I'm a senior data engineer and work fully remotely. The entire company is remote.

I can generally work ""U.S. business hours"" but might work East Coast hours one day and West Coast hours the next day depending on what works for my schedule. If I need to be gone for an hour in the middle of the day, I block it off on my calendar. If I need to go to a longer appointment, I'll book it either at the beginning or end of the day, block it off on my work calendar, then let people know in Slack the day before. If I need to flex more than two hours like that, I usually just take half a sick day--I think I get 9 sick days a year? ""Unlimited"" vacation days, though. The assumption is that sick days are short-notice while vacation days are approved in advance.

I usually have two 1-hour meetings on Mondays, then no meetings the rest of the week; every 4-6 weeks, I have a 30-minute meeting with my manager. There is a monthly Engineering ""meeting"", but it's recorded, so you only need to join the Zoom if you feel like watching live or want to ask questions in the Q\&A; the agenda is provided in advance. Everything else is asynchronous, including the daily standups, Product updates, etc., unless you want to ask someone questions ""live"" to debug a project you're working on. Then, a meeting is scheduled. ""Just hopping on a call"" isn't really a thing in my team, because if you need to ask detailed questions on how to do something, that means the documentation needs to be improved, which means someone needs to write more down for the next person. So again: the call should have an agenda prepared and sent in advance.

I am on-call 24/7 a week at a time, every 6ish weeks. There are rarely pages outside of business hours, though. Only a few times per year.

I would say all the flexibility on my team is because everyone is senior+, so no one really requires close ""supervision"" per se. We also have tight delivery deadlines, so regardless of schedule flexibility, you won't last long if you don't get your work done.",5
1q70p8d,9,Fully remote. Super flexible hours (just be there for important meetings/ones that you can contribute to). 2 stand ups a weeks. Additional meetings can be none a week to about 6 a week.,4
1q70p8d,10,"Hours flexibility - 9-5 strict-ish, boss is extremely flexible if given notice, but has to enforce rules because some folks abuse the flexibility. Varies by company, culture, team, boss, etc.

Meeting count - Depends on the workload, and the needs of the team that week. Could be a 10%, could be 50%, rarely more than 50% on any given day.

Work/life balance - My boss is very fair. If you gave an extra hour, it's yours, take it back some time, as long as there's not a fire drill going on. But, I think that's more specific to your boss.

Overall - If you like your boss, your tech stack, your team, and are paid well enough, that's golden handcuffs! Right now, you'd have to pay me 2-3x to go in-office.

TL,DR - 
The boss, team, type of work, salary, and growth opportunities should drive a majority of your decision. The remote part is just a big fat juicy cherry on top.",3

Our last ditch effort is actually building a custom LLM / SLM that can function as a medium between the business and the catalog.

I’m quite jaded and my role is more of an analytic engineer / data modeler but the longer I work the more I realize self-service is just a pipe dream at most mid-tier places.

But it's a way to get you practical experience on something end-to-end without being too high stakes.

If you really want to practice before you join, build a DAG in Airflow just to understand how it works. Meta uses Data Swarm as an orchestrator which is most similar to Airflow, but they've abstracted so much as to make it trivial to create a new DAG. With Data Swarm you're not even really building a DAG, you're just building the config and the back end logic is doing most of the work for you. 

They also have a custom visualization software, so play around with the free version of Looker or Tableau. Most onboarding projects are going to be something like ""take this raw data, build a denormalized / aggregate table, build a dashboard on it""

Previously: your table consisted of partition files, each 1 Tb. So when you scanned from select \* from table where date = x; you scanned just this big file.

With clustering: now each partition is not one big file but many smaller files, organized in a smart way. 

Like **table\_partition\_field1** and inside this file data will be sorted by field2.


But if field1 is low cardinality (let’s say - Country or even bool field), then BigQuery can do more specific files:

Like **table\_partition\_field1\_field2**. 

So that’s why when you query still leverages clustering.

DE is a subset of SWE but so is backend, frontend, devops, platform etc. Companies will post SWE jobs but in most cases they are looking for a backend or frontend engineer. There is some overlap but not enough especially in today's competitive environment (you'll be up against some experienced and capable engineers who match the description much closer than a DE can). What I'm trying to say is that even though you'll find a ton of ""software engineer"" job postings, there is no such thing as a company hiring for a ""general SWE"" (it's always one of the subsets and most likely backend).

The exception are companies who post for software engineers and make it clear in the job title or description that the focus is data. I've found things like ""Software Engineer - Data Warehousing"" or ""Software Engineer - Data"".

1q6hnaf,3,"i remember being in your shoes, with a bunch of certs and no idea how to get that first practical break, the gap between learning and doing can feel huge. practical exposure is key, and honestly, picking a tool like DataFlint or even similar ones from the market and building a mini-project around data governance issues (think lineage, quality, or access controls) is something that makes you stand out, especially since not many applicants show their thinking in action. make sure you document your process and put it up on github or a blog, gives you talking points and something to walk through during interviews, plus it shows initiative. interviewers love when you can walk them through how you solved a real problem or handled a hiccup, instead of just textbook answers. keep an eye on roles with data wrangling or process improvement tasks and don’t be shy to reach out to people in those jobs on linkedin, sometimes a quick intro leads to a referral or feedback you never expected.",1
1q6hhef,1,"Yeah, it should work. I wouldn’t enable the ‘automatic’ option, but you should know your table well enough to choose which fields should be included in the liquid clustering command. 

And don’t create/populate the table and enable liquid clustering afterwards. Have the table existing with the feature enabled before writing (so don’t use CTAS or overwrite).",3
1q6hhef,2,"I think the limit is mostly hardware and cost, so as long as the cluster/warehouse can handle the IO and compute, 100 TB by itself isn’t a blocker.

But the more interesting question is why you’d need liquid clustering on a 100 TB table in the first place.

At that size, it often looks like a raw or near-raw table, and raw tables usually have predictable access patterns (time-range filters, append-only writes). In those cases, directory-level partitioning on a timestamp is usually sufficient and cheaper, because partition pruning is extremely effective and requires no ongoing reorganization.

Liquid clustering starts to make sense at this scale when:

* Queries frequently filter on high-cardinality keys (e.g. account\_id) in addition to time.
* The table isn’t strictly append-only (MERGE/UPSERT, late data, corrections).
* Access patterns evolve and you don’t want to constantly redesign partitions.
* You want to avoid over-partitioning while still getting good file-level pruning.

So the question isn’t “can liquid clustering handle 100 TB?”, but rather whether the workload actually needs it. For a truly raw, time-sliced dataset, partitions alone are usually the right tool. Liquid clustering is more justified when the table behaves less like raw ingestion and more like a shared, multi-consumer analytical dataset where time alone isn’t selective enough.",2
1q6hhef,3,"probably should check databricks docs, limits are usually hardware-related",1
1q6hhef,4,"liquid clustering supports large data sets, and databricks scales up pretty well, but once you hit 100tb, all sorts of edge cases pop up. you might want to use DataFlint to monitor those spark jobs since it spots pipeline issues before they get ugly. careful with the shuffle size and worker memory, small changes there can make a huge difference, keep testing as you scale.",2

1q6frgw,1,"I tried finding what I'm thinking of so I can be wrong, especially since I'm not a MySQL expert, but I think inserting is better with larger files. I'm not sure how many actual GB your 250e6 record file is, but it may be worth just doing that?

Also, I see that your table is indexed - remove indexing before import and index on added data after.

Edit:

What I was thinking of was actually about `LOAD DATA` -- it's better to use `LOAD DATA` for larger imports than `INSERT`: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/9.5/en/load-data.html",19
1q6frgw,2,You might have a lock on the table/indexes.  Maybe drop the indexes and rebuild afterwards?,22
1q6frgw,3,"Since, your table is indexed, you are most likely running into a bottleneck. Basically, when your table is empty, MySQL just throws the data in. But as the table grows (after those first few million rows), MySQL has to work strictly harder to update the indexes and check constraints for every single batch you send. It spends more time shuffling the index tree than actually storing your data.

Try using ""rewriteBatchedStatements=true"" in your JDBC Connection String and let us knw if it solves the performance issue.

Also, if it is one time thing or full reload, you would be better off dropping the indexes, the non-primary ones at least, before you begin with the load/reload.

Hope this helps.",8
1q6frgw,4,"Make a new table, no index but same schema, different name

use load Data to insert into the new table

Remove the old table and rename the New table to the old name.

slap your indexes and point the fks to the new table if any exist.",7
1q6frgw,5,Why did you divide it into files? How did you do it? Is the table indexed? ,2
1q6frgw,6,"Keep in mind MySQL supports up to 1000 inserts per statement, so if speed is important you might consider batching them.

eg:

Insert into table (a,b,c)
VALUES (1,'d','e'), (2,'f','g');",2
1q6frgw,7,"""load data"" is more efficient for large imports, and as several others suggested, dropping indices helps avoiding bottlenecks. When you insert data in the empty table no checks are done and import is done in no time. But when you have already loaded many files each insert has to check for constraints and your performances drop.  
  
Updating statistics for the table after each batch import might also improve performances.",2
1q6frgw,8,"indexes cause writes to be slower because they require updating the index/maintaining its integrity. 

the simplest solution is to write each of the files to their own table, then after they're in the DB then you can just merge them into one using a union from spark.",2
1q6frgw,9,"Is the source data already in another table or are they in files?

1q6frgw,10,"Have you checked metrics and logs to see why the later files are taking longer? Like do you have a monolith script that is doing both the splitting into sub files and then looping thru them all?

1q6cug2,1,"Ultimately the best data catalogs include data lineage information from the metadata they ingest. The purpose of a catalog ultimately is to be the single source of truth for questions around data usage, data security policies, business semantics, etc. It’s a coordination mechanism for the company to know how things come together. Lineage is a huge part of this because it shows not just how data flows from a transformation perspective, but also how systems connect. I personally wouldn’t want to make the investment in a catalog tool if it didn’t also include lineage.",8
1q6cug2,2,"Short answer is yes.  I've used Unity Catalog by Databricks, Alation, and OpenMetadata for this.  More of the last two.  Ablation is spiffy, but costly and a hard sell.  Openmetadata is what I'm running now and does the job just fine.  I think we're moving towards Unity catalog as they are going to add connections to outside sources.",3
1q6cug2,3,"To be honest, I see only two options how can it be possible:  
\- Data Catalog is tightly integrated with your query engine  
\- Data Catalog has an API to ingest lineage from the query engine

First option will work only if it is a vendor solution (like Databricks + Unity) or if the catalog itself is a part of query engine. So, you either will have a vendor lock or mixing different entities in one (like Hive Metastore + Hive SQL).

Second option looks nice, for example, an OpenLineage standard can be used, but the existence of lineage in catalog will depend on query engine.

If I would build a solution on open source technologies, I would prefer a second option. Something like DataHub that supports OpenLineage ingestion via REST API. But I would avoid heavily tighten ""all-in-one"" solutions and would keep lineage as an option.",2
1q6cug2,4,"In my experience, lineage and catalogs solve real (and different) problems, and having them together can be genuinely useful for ownership and understanding how data evolves.

Where teams still struggle is after that. Even with good lineage and a solid catalog, it’s often unclear which data is actually sensitive and whether current access is appropriate as things change.

That’s usually where security comes in - not to replace governance tools, but to make them actionable from a risk perspective.",1
1q6cug2,5,Dagster,1
1q6cug2,6,Yes there's no point having a catalog that doesn't also do lineage.,1
1q6cug2,7,Yes that would be useful. Most companies are doing a terrible job in specifically this area.,1
1q6cug2,8,"for me, the value really comes when the lineage and catalog are integrated not as two separate things but as a single pane, the context is all there, no switching around. DataFlint comes to mind if you’re deep into Spark, it picks up a lot around workflow and performance, pretty helpful if you want lineage plus operational details together. you might want to check out Atlan or Amundsen too for more catalog features, it’s kind of a spectrum depending how much automation or discovery you want. bottom line, start from whatever problem eats up your team’s time most, add tools to hit that pain point first, always easier to expand later than to backtrack.",1
1q6cug2,9,"That overlap you’re seeing is real, and honestly, a combined solution is becoming the standard rather than a ""nice-to-have."" In my experience, separating them usually leads to one becoming stale because they rely on the same underlying metadata context to be useful.

Here is how I’ve seen this play out in practice -

1. The Platform Approach (Unity Catalog) **-** I’ve used Unity Catalog extensively for this. It essentially forces the catalog and lineage to live together. Because the governance (permissions, access controls) creates the lineage automatically as jobs run, you don't have to ""maintain"" the lineage separately. The catalog is the map of the lineage. If you treat them as separate tools, you end up doing double the work to keep them in sync.

2. The Open Source Route (OpenMetadata) **-** If you are looking outside of a specific vendor ecosystem, tools like OpenMetadata are tackling this exact ""all-in-one"" problem. They treat data assets, lineage, and quality checks as a single entity. It proves that the market prefers a unified view. Data engineers don't want to tab switch between a catalog to find a table and a lineage tool to see where it came from.

3. The Shift to Orchestrators (Dagster) - The most interesting shift right now is actually happening in the orchestration layer. I’ve been using Dagster, and they handle this through “software-defined Assets."" Instead of lineage being an afterthought or a documentation task, the lineage is defined by the code itself.

* Assets **-** You define the data asset, and the lineage is inherent.
* Asset Checks **-** You attach quality checks directly to those assets in the graph.

So, to answer your question, Yes, a combined solution is useful. In fact, things are moving even further, merging Catalog + Lineage + Execution (Orchestration) into one view so that ""accountability"" isn't just a log you look at later, but part of the pipeline run itself.

Hope this helps.",0
1q6cug2,10,"**Yes - combined catalog + lineage is the way to go**, and it's becoming the standard rather than a ""nice-to-have.""  
  
From working on DataHub at LinkedIn, here's what I learned: **separating them creates semantic drift at scale.** Your lineage says ""user\_events\_v2"", your catalog says ""user\_events"", and nobody knows if they're the same thing. When you have 100K+ datasets, this breaks governance completely.  
  
**Why integration matters more than people realize:**  
• **Metadata propagation** \- tag one source table as PII, lineage cascades it downstream to 50 derived tables automatically. Manual tagging doesn't scale.   
• **Impact analysis** \- ""this pipeline failed, who owns the upstream data?"" If you're jumping between tools, you've already lost.   
• **Trust flows backwards** \- you can't assess data quality without tracing upstream. Separate systems = manual stitching every time.  


Most of the modern catalogs are moving to a model of  
\- out-of-the-box connectors that ""pull"" lineage into the system from external systems  
\- support reporting of lineage INTO the system via standard catalog-native API-s/agents/emitters or vendor-neutral protocols like OpenLineage

  
**The caveat the other responses touched on:** some solutions like Dagster's ""software-defined assets"" are elegant but only work for what the orchestrator controls. Your data doesn't start in the warehouse:  
• Production systems feeding Kafka streams   
• Real-time stream processing (Flink, Spark Streaming)   
• Cross-cloud data movement that never touches your orchestrator   
  
At my previous company, \~40% of critical lineage came from **outside** the orchestration layer. You need a catalog that can **aggregate lineage from multiple systems** (streaming, production databases, warehouses), not just generate it from one orchestrator.  
  
**The test:** can you trace a BI dashboard → warehouse → dbt → Kafka → production database in one query? That's 5-6 systems owned by different teams. The catalog is your aggregation point. Best of luck with convincing your customers and the world!",-1

1q6862h,5,"First step: get it out of CSV (row-based). Convert it to columnar storage like parquet or iceberg. That alone will make it smaller and much faster to query.

After that, where to host it depends on budget, growth, and your existing stack. For \~1M rows / 1 - 2GB:

* Postgres (managed) works fine and integrates cleanly with many computing platforms.
* DuckDB / MotherDuck is great if you want simple, fast SQL over Parquet without much infra. Note, MotherDuck is PaaS version of DuckDB
* AWS, Azure, GCP platforms if your org already has them.
