1qvs39y,I built an interactive country rankings tool as my first indie app — would love feedback 🙏,"Hi,

I recently launched my first indie SaaS project, [**https://country-rankings.com**](https://country-rankings.com/), and I’d really love some honest feedback from this community.

I aggregate country-level datasets from public sources and present them as interactive, explorable visualizations (rankings, comparisons, trends and relationships), so it’s easier to spot patterns and tell data stories across countries. One specific goal I’m working toward is making it easy to export both visualizations and raw data so they can be reused in reports, research, or presentations.

A few things I’d especially love your thoughts on:

* Is this kind of tool useful or interesting for researchers, analysts, or data folks?
* Do the visualizations make the data easier to understand, or are there parts that feel confusing or unnecessary?
* What would you expect or want more of if you were using this for analysis or research?

This is my first time building and launching something like this on my own, so all feedback — positive or critical — is very welcome. I’m mainly trying to learn whether I’m solving a real problem and how I can improve it.

Thanks a lot for your time and feedback — it means a lot 🙏",1770220141.0,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1qvs39y/i_built_an_interactive_country_rankings_tool_as/
1qvi9j6,"I built a ""AI chart generator"" workflow… and it killed 85% of my reporting busywork","Over the break I kept seeing the same thing: my analysis was fine, but I was burning time turning tables into presentable charts.

So I built a simple workflow around an AI chart generator. It started as a personal thing. Then a teammate asked for it. Then another. Now it's basically the default ""make it deck-ready"" step after we validate numbers.

Here's what I learned (the hard way):

**1) The chart is not the analysis — the spec is**

If you just say ""make a chart"", you'll get something pretty and potentially wrong.

What works is writing a **chart spec** like you're handing it to an analyst who doesn't know your context:

* **Goal:** what decision does this chart support?
* **Metric definition:** formula + numerator/denominator
* **Grain:** daily/weekly/monthly + timezone
* **Aggregation:** sum/avg/unique + filters
* **Segments:** top N logic + ""Other""
* **Guardrails:** start y-axis at 0 (unless rates), no dual-axis, show units

**2) ""Chart-ready table"" beats ""raw export"" every time**

I keep a rule: **one row = one observation**.

**If I have to explain joins in prose, the chart step will be fragile.**

**3) Sanity checks are the difference between speed and embarrassment**

Before I share anything:

* totals match the source table
* axis labels + units are present
* time grain is correct
* category ordering isn’t hiding the story

**The impact**

This didn't replace analysis. It replaced the repetitive formatting loop.

Result: faster updates, fewer review cycles, and less ""can you just change the colors / order / labels"".If you want to try the tool I'm building around this workflow: [ChartGen.AI](http://ChartGen.AI) (free to start).",1770190554.0,0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1qvi9j6/i_built_a_ai_chart_generator_workflow_and_it/
1qvfukx,Seeking Alternatives for Large-Scale Glassdoor Data Collection,"# Seeking Alternatives for Large-Scale Glassdoor Data Collection

## Project Context

I've built a **four-phase data pipeline** for analyzing Glassdoor company reviews:

1. **Web scraping** Forbes Global 2000 companies using Selenium/BeautifulSoup
2. **Custom Chrome extension** for Glassdoor link collection with DuckDuckGo integration  
3. **AI-powered scalable data collection** via Apify and Make workflows
4. **Comprehensive analysis** with 20+ visualizations and interactive PowerBI dashboard

## Current Dataset

**After cleaning:** 6,971 employee reviews from 127 major US corporations with 24 structured data fields (ratings, job titles, locations, review content, metadata)

**Before cleaning:** ~11,900 records

## The Challenge

I'm trying to scale up to **500K+ records** for more robust analysis, but hitting major roadblocks:

### What I've Tried:
- ❌ **Apify** - Works but costs $500+ for the volume I need
- ❌ **Firecrawl** - No success due to Glassdoor's protections
- ❌ **Selenium** - Blocked by anti-bot measures
- ❌ **BeautifulSoup** - Same issue with strict policies

### The Problem:
Glassdoor has **extremely strict anti-scraping policies** and sophisticated bot detection that makes large-scale data collection nearly impossible without significant cost.

## What I'm Looking For

**Alternative approaches or tools** for gathering large-scale employee review data that either:
- Bypass Glassdoor's restrictions more cost-effectively
- Use alternative legitimate data sources (datasets, APIs, academic access)
- Implement creative workarounds within ethical/legal boundaries

## Question for the Community

Has anyone successfully collected large-scale employee review data (100K+ records) without breaking the bank? What methods or alternatives would you recommend?

Any suggestions for:
- Cost-effective scraping services or tools?
- Pre-existing Glassdoor datasets (Kaggle, academic sources)?
- Alternative platforms with similar data but more accessible?
- Proxy/rotation strategies that actually work?

---

**Tech Stack:** Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Apify, Make, Chrome Extensions, PowerBI

**Budget:** Looking for solutions

1qv2ukw,Looking for feedback on a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language,"I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.

I’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.

Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.

One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.

The second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.

BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.

1quvimi,How I Learned SQL in 4 Months Coming from a Non-Technical Background,"Sharing my insights from an article I wrote back in Nov, 2022 published in Medium as I thought it may be valuable to some here.

For some background, I got hired in a tech logistics company called Upaya as a business analyst after they raised $1.5m in Series A. Since the company was growing fast, they wanted proper dashboards & better reporting for all 4 of their verticals.

They gave me a chance to explore the role as a Data Analyst which I agreed on since I saw potential in that role(especially considering pre-AI days). I had a tight time frame to provide deliverables valuable to the company and that helped me get to something tangible.

The main part of my workflow was SQL as this was integral to the dashboards we were creating as well as conducting analysis & ad-hoc reports. Looking back, the main output was a proper dashboard system custom to requirements of different departments all coded back with SQL. This helped automate much of the reporting process that happened weekly & monthly at the company.

I'm not at the company anymore but my ex-manager said their still using it and have built on top of it. I'm happy with that since the company has grown big and raised $14m (among biggest startup investments in a small country like Nepal).

Here is my learning experience insights:

1. Start with a real, high-stakes project

I would argue this was the most important thing. It forced me to not meander around as I had accountability up to the CEO and the stakes were high considering the size of the company. It really forced me to be on my A-game and be away from a passive learning mindset into one where you focus on the important. I cannot stress this more!

2. Jump in at the intermediate level

Real-world work uses JOINs, sub-queries, etc. so start immediately with them. By doing this, you will end up covering the basics anyways (especially with A.I. nowadays it makes more sense)

3. Apply the 80/20 rule to queries

20% or so of queries are used more than 80% of the time in real projects.

JOINS, UNION & UNION ALL, CASE WHEN, IF, GROUP BY, ROW\_NUMBER, LAG/LEAD are major ones. It is important to give disproportionate attention to them.

Again, if you work on an actual project, this kind of disproportion of use becomes clearer.

4. Seek immediate feedback

Another important point that may not be present especially when self-learning but effective. Tech team validated query accuracy while stakeholders judged usefulness of what I was building. Looking back if that feedback loop wasn't present, I think I would probably go around in circles in many unnecessary areas.

1qsoy80,“Learn Python” usually means very different things. This helped me understand it better.,"People often say *“learn Python”*.

What confused me early on was that Python isn’t one skill you finish. It’s a group of tools, each meant for a different kind of problem.

This image summarizes that idea well. I’ll add some context from how I’ve seen it used.



**Web scraping**  
This is Python interacting with websites.

Common tools:

* `requests` to fetch pages
* `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` to read HTML
* `Selenium` when sites behave like apps
* `Scrapy` for larger crawling jobs

Useful when data isn’t already in a file or database.



**Data manipulation**  
This shows up almost everywhere.

* `pandas` for tables and transformations
* `NumPy` for numerical work
* `SciPy` for scientific functions
* `Dask` / `Vaex` when datasets get large

When this part is shaky, everything downstream feels harder.



**Data visualization**  
Plots help you think, not just present.

* `matplotlib` for full control
* `seaborn` for patterns and distributions
* `plotly` / `bokeh` for interaction
* `altair` for clean, declarative charts

Bad plots hide problems. Good ones expose them early.



**Machine learning**  
This is where predictions and automation come in.

* `scikit-learn` for classical models
* `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch` for deep learning
* `Keras` for faster experiments

Models only behave well when the data work before them is solid.



**NLP**  
Text adds its own messiness.

* `NLTK` and `spaCy` for language processing
* `Gensim` for topics and embeddings
* `transformers` for modern language models

Understanding text is as much about context as code.



**Statistical analysis**  
This is where you check your assumptions.

* `statsmodels` for statistical tests
* `PyMC` / `PyStan` for probabilistic modeling
* `Pingouin` for cleaner statistical workflows

Statistics help you decide what to trust.



**Why this helped me**  
I stopped trying to “learn Python” all at once.

Instead, I focused on:

* What problem did I had
* Which layer did it belong to
* Which tool made sense there

That mental model made learning calmer and more practical.

Curious how others here approached this.

1qsakoi,Loading data into R,"Hi all, I’m in grad school and relatively new to statistics software. My university encourages us to use R, and that’s what they taught us in our grad statistics class. Well now I’m trying to start a project using the NCES ECLS-K:2011 dataset (which is quite large) and I’m not quite sure how to upload it into an R data frame.

Basically, NCES provides a bunch of syntax files (.sps .sas .do .dct) and the .dat file. In my stats class we were always just given the pared down .sav file to load directly into R.

I tried a bunch of things and was eventually able to load something, but while the variable names look like they’re probably correct, the labels are reporting as “null” and the values are nonsense. Clearly whatever I did doesn’t parse the ASCII data file correctly.

Anyway, the only “easy” solution I can think of is to use stata or spss on the computers at school to create a file that would be readable by R. Are there any other options? Maybe someone could point me to better R code? TIA!",1769885151.0,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1qsakoi/loading_data_into_r/

Do you have any experiences, tips, or best practices like

**1. Life changing THE thing you consider must-have or amazing in your data stack**

* What are the *game-changers* or optimizations that have significantly improved your data stack?
* Any examples of configurations, macros, or packages that saved you a ton of time?

**2. Detecting Issues in Ingested Data**

* What **techniques or mechanisms** do you use to identify problems in your data (e.g., duplicate events, weak signals like inconsistencies between clicks and views, etc.)? Best if automatized but taking everything !
* Do you have tools or scripts to automate this detection?

**3. Testing**

* How do you handle testing for:
   * **Technical changes** that shouldn’t impact tables (e.g., refactoring)?
   * **Business logic changes** that modify data but require checking for edge cases?
* Currently, I’m doing a row-by-row comparison to spot inconsistencies, but it’s tedious and well not perfect (hello my 3 PRs of this week...). Do you have better alternatives?

**4. Dashboarding and need scoping**

* What are your **preferred methods** for designing dashboards or delivering analyses?
* How do you scope efficiently, ensuring that the Sales at the bottom **will** use your dashboard, because it helps them (hello my 2 weeks on two unused dashboards :') )
* Do you use specific frameworks (e.g., AARRR, OKRs) or tools to automate report generation?

1qq3t2x,A visual summary of Python features that show up most in everyday code,"When people start learning Python, they often feel stuck.

Too many videos.  
Too many topics.  
No clear idea of what to focus on first.

This cheat sheet works because it shows the parts of Python you actually use when writing code.

A quick breakdown in plain terms:

**→ Basics and variables**  
You use these everywhere. Store values. Print results.  
If this feels shaky, everything else feels harder than it should.

**→ Data structures**  
Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.  
Most real problems come down to choosing the right one.  
Pick the wrong structure and your code becomes messy fast.

**→ Conditionals**  
This is how Python makes decisions.  
Questions like:  
– Is this value valid?  
– Does this row meet my rule?

**→ Loops**  
Loops help you work with many things at once.  
Rows in a file. Items in a list.  
They save you from writing the same line again and again.

**→ Functions**  
This is where good habits start.  
Functions help you reuse logic and keep code readable.  
Almost every real project relies on them.

**→ Strings**  
Text shows up everywhere.  
Names, emails, file paths.  
Knowing how to handle text saves a lot of time.

**→ Built-ins and imports**  
Python already gives you powerful tools.  
You don’t need to reinvent them.  
You just need to know they exist.

**→ File handling**  
Real data lives in files.  
You read it, clean it, and write results back.  
This matters more than beginners usually realize.

**→ Classes**  
Not needed on day one.  
But seeing them early helps later.  
They’re just a way to group data and behavior together.

Don’t try to memorize this sheet.

Write small programs from it.  
Make mistakes.  
Fix them.

That’s when Python starts to feel normal.

Hope this helps someone who’s just starting out.

One of the explanations is of course rating inflation, but I'm sure many hidden contributing features could be studied as well, such as time management, style of games, and so on.

1qox87g,Is using synthetic data for portfolio projects worthwhile?,"I’m aiming to break into the data analyst field and I’m still at an early stage. I’m aware of platforms like Kaggle, but I’m not sure whether Kaggle projects alone are enough to stand out to recruiters.

I’m considering building more advanced portfolio projects using **synthetic data**. For example, I could generate a realistic dataset for an automotive or life insurance use case with many features and variables, then perform exploratory data analysis, identify relationships, build insights, and communicate findings as I would in a real-world project.

My concern is whether recruiters would see this negatively — for example, assuming that because I generated the data myself, I already “knew” the correlations or outcomes in advance, which might reduce the credibility of the analysis.

Is synthetic data generally acceptable for portfolio projects, and if so, how should it be framed or explained to recruiters to avoid this issue?

I’ve set up a simple site where testers can download the current build:  
👉 [https://data-cleaner-hub.vercel.app/](https://data-cleaner-hub.vercel.app/)

The app runs **entirely locally** no cloud processing, no AI, no external services.  
Your data never leaves your machine.

It’s designed for cleaning messy real-world datasets (Excel/CSV exports) before they break downstream workflows.

# Current features:

* Excel & CSV preview before cleanup
* Detection of common inconsistencies
* Duplicate and empty-row detection
* Column-level format standardization
* Multi-format export
* Fully offline/local processing

This is an early testing build, not a polished release.  
The goal right now is validation through real usage.

Looking for feedback on:

* Failure cases
* Performance with large files
* Missing workflows
* UX problems
* Real-world edge cases
* Things that would make this actually useful in production pipelines

1qmu3e3,Stop testing Senior Data Analyst/Scientist on their ability to code,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been a Data Science consultant for 5 years now, and I’ve written an endless amount of SQL and Python. But I’ve noticed that the more senior I become, the less I actually know how to code. Honestly, I’ve grown to hate technical interviews with live coding challenges.

I think part of this is natural. Moving into team and Project Management roles shifts your focus toward the ""big picture."" However, I’d say 70% of this change is due to the rise of AI agents like ChatGPT, Copilot, and GitLab Duo that i am using a lot. When these tools can generate foundational code in seconds, why should I spend mental energy memorizing syntax?

I agree that we still need to know how to read code, debug it, and verify that an AI's output actually solves the problem. But I think it’s time for recruiters to stop asking for ""code experts"" with 5–8 years of experience. At this level, juniors are often better at the ""rote"" coding anyway. In a world where we should be prioritizing critical thinking and deep analytical strategy, recruiters are still testing us like it’s 2015.

Am I alone in this frustration? What kind of roles should we try to look for as we get more experienced?

1qmer6f,I built a privacy-first Excel cleaner because I was tired of uploading sensitive data to random websites [Free for 1 Month]," Hey everyone,

I work with data a lot, and I always hated the anxiety of uploading my messy CSVs containing client info to those random ""Free Online CSV Cleaner"" websites just to remove duplicates or fix date formats.

I realized that with modern browsers, we don't actually need a server to clean text data. Your laptop is powerful enough.

So I built **DataCure** – a 100% client-side data cleaning tool. **The USP is simple:** Your data never leaves your device. It works offline, it’s faster because there's no upload/download, and it’s private.

**It handles:**

* **Auto Scan & Resolve** (Smartly detects issues and fixes them in one click—100% locally)
* **Deduplication** (Instant, check by specific columns)
* **Date Standardization** (Fix messy formats like `DD-MM-YYYY` to `YYYY-MM-DD` automatically)
* **PII Masking** (Redact emails/phones for safe sharing)
* **Text Cleaning** (Trim whitespace, Title Case, Upper/Lower case)
* **Split & Merge Columns** (Split names by space, comma, etc.)
* **Find & Replace** (Bulk update values across columns)
* **Number Cleaning** (Fix currency strings like `$1,200.00` \-> `1200`)
* **Remove Empty Rows** (Clean up whitespace-heavy exports)
* **Reorder/Hide Columns** (Organize your view before export)

It's a freemium tool (server costs are low, but I put a lot of time into the UI), but I want to give the Reddit community 1 month of full Pro access for free to get some feedback.

1. Why can't the AI also change cells in the file we give to it?
2. Why can't we modify this grid ourselves?

So besides the whole READ and text-to-SQL flows, what seemed to be really missing was giving the user a nice and easy way to ask AI to change the file without much hassle which seems to be a pretty good use case for LLMs.

1qjbdxc,"Feedback on low‑code, customer‑facing AI analytics/dashboard builder","Hi all,

I’m working on PMF for a product in the AI analytics space and would really appreciate some honest feedback from this community.

Current state:  
I have a server‑side text‑to‑SQL and text‑to‑visualization system that can explore a database and generate charts from a single natural‑language prompt. You can improve accuracy with “gold” queries and DB annotations, and it works reasonably well for ad‑hoc analysis.

However, when it comes to customer‑facing analytics, most companies seem to prefer fully embeddable dashboard solutions with management, permissions, etc. Because of that, I started building a low‑code, embeddable UI on top of this engine, focused on customer‑facing AI dashboards.

High‑level idea:

* Frontend is embeddable with something like `<QuerypanelEmbedded dashboardId="""" />` in your app.
* Auth is handled via JWT issued by your backend and stored client‑side.
* The UI has a simple text‑block editor (titles, paragraphs, charts) for composing dashboards.
* Charts are generated by AI through a chat‑style modal, with history and versioning.
* The dashboard can summarize how data has changed over a selected time period.
* Admins can build charts in Querypanel and deploy them to customers with one click.
* Tenants/customers can customize their own dashboards (with RBAC‑style controls).

Questions for you:

* Is this something you would consider using instead of building dashboards in‑house or using existing BI tools?
* What would be the main blockers or “no‑go”s for adopting a tool like this (security, governance, explainability, UX, etc.)?
* Are there any features that feel like “must‑haves” that are missing from the description?

Any candid feedback (including “this is not needed” or “already solved”) would be super helpful. Prototype is here if you'd like to have a look: [https://querypanel.io/prototype](https://querypanel.io/prototype)

Will an ANOVA be sufficient to see if there is a significant impact of the background? Do I need to do a gage R&R on the equipment first (knowing that it's kind of new and barely used)?

1qhy2oq,"Is NVIDIA Overvalued, Undervalued or Fairly Valued?","I analyzed NVIDIA to understand whether its recent market boom is supported by financial fundamentals or just driven by market speculation.

**What I analyzed:**

\- ROCE, operating margins, Earning per share (EPS), Dividend per share (DPS), P/E

\- Share price trends

\- Daily returns and beta using regression on python

**Key Findings:**

The analysis confirms that NVIDIA's extraordinary market performance is strongly supported by financial fundamentals and not merely speculation. ROCE, operating margins and EPS demonstrated that the company is converting capital and revenue into profits. The rapid expansion in earnings has allowed valuation pressure to ease, as evidenced by the declining P/E ratio in 2024 and 2025, indicating that fundamentals are catching up with price rather than the stock becoming cheaper due to falling investor expectations.  

However, the technical and risk analysis highlights that NVIDIA remains a high volatile stock with frequent sharp fluctuations. A beta of 1.77 confirms that NVIDIA amplifies overall market movements while CAPM results show that more than one-third of daily return variation is driven by firm-specific factors.

1qh3b1q,How filtering outdated and duplicate data improved data reliability in analysis,"For a long time, our default rule was simple: keep the data unless it’s obviously broken.

The thinking was that more data equals more signal. In reality, it often meant more outdated data and noisier analysis. Numbers moved around even when nothing meaningful had changed.

The mindset shift was when we stopped asking “Is this record valid?” and started asking “Is this record still useful?” That question alone changed a lot.

Data normalization came first. Once formats, timestamps, and identifiers were aligned, it became much easier to see where things didn’t line up. After that, real-time data filtering helped us drop records that looked fine structurally but hadn’t shown recent activity.

Removing duplicate data reduced clutter, but it wasn’t the main win. The biggest improvement came from improving data reliability by filtering out stale rows early, before they influenced aggregates or trends.

With TNTwuyou data filtering, we focused on normalization rules and activity windows as part of preprocessing, not cleanup. The dataset shrank, but signal-to-noise improved a lot.

I would like to visualize the size of the globe-shaped broodnest and access that at any time over a network.

Heat rises.

I have nine temperature sensors arranged across the gaps between the combs, and one outside the box.

What the image shows is a heatmap of each sensor-minus-outside, the delta being heat generated. And also a scatter plot of only the outside temperature.  

""It works"" in the sense of being able to see a heat signature of the nest at any given vertical band of time. But it doesn't work in the sense of displaying change over time, specifically because the outside temperature fluctuates a lot.

1qgvt8f,How Can Edge-Case Workflow Flaws Affect Data Analytics?,"Hi r/DataAnalysis,

I recently explored a large SaaS platform and discovered some unusual workflow behaviors that exposed hidden logic and permission issues. Nothing malicious — just observing what happens when the system is used in unexpected ways.

Here’s why it matters for data analysts:

Data integrity risks: Account, payment, and wallet balances could go out of sync, making dashboards and reports unreliable.

Anomaly detection opportunities: These edge cases highlight patterns analysts could flag to catch unusual behavior early.

Impact on KPIs: Corrupted or inconsistent data could affect forecasts, business metrics, and decision-making.

Monitoring & validation: Insights like these can guide better dashboards, alerts, and workflow checks.

Cross-team collaboration: Understanding these system weaknesses helps analysts communicate effectively with IT, QA, and security teams.

Questions for the community:

Have you seen workflow issues create “invisible” data problems in your work?

How do you design dashboards or alerts to catch these rare anomalies?

Any best practices for communicating potential data risks from unusual system behaviour

As a side project I built a very small Windows tool to automate the boring part:

• auto-detects encoding & delimiter  
• removes empty columns and duplicate rows  
• can process a whole folder in one go (batch mode)  
• no Python / no install / just a single `.exe` (Windows only)

I’m currently experimenting with selling it for a small price on Gumroad, but before I go further I’d really like feedback from people who actually work with data every day:

• what are the first edge cases that would completely break this for you?  
• which “must-have” features are missing for your typical CSV exports?

1qcghcl,How does a bayesian calculator work?,"Heya,

The marketing team I’m the analyst for, is all about Bayesian. They use an online calculator that provides probability (with a non informative prior) that A > B. Then at 80% probability they implement the variant. So they accept to be wrong 1/5 times.

However recently they did an A/A test and they’re all in panic because the probability is 79% that A>A. So I was asked to investigate whether this was worrysome.

Now I ran a simulation of the test, to see how often I got a result that they considered ‘interesting’. The result was about 40% of the times the calculator shows A > B or B > A with 80% probability when there is no real difference, regardless of sample size.

My assumption was that the more data you have (law of large number) the more the calculator seems to get it correctly (so deviating around 50%).

This assumption seems wrong however and the Bayesian calculator exactly does what it reports. 20% of the times it will say lower than 20% prob, 60% deviated between 20% and 60% and 20% of the times over 80%. Meaning if a hypothesis is non directional, you have 40% chance to see a change when there is non.

1qbo4zp,Built a Real Estate Market Intelligence Pipeline Dashboard using Python + Power BI (Learning Project),"This is a learning project where I attempted to build an end-to-end analytics pipeline and visualize the results using Power BI.

Project overview:

I designed a simple data pipeline using static real estate data to understand how different tools fit together in an analytics workflow, from raw data collection to business-facing dashboards.

Pipeline components:

• GitHub – used as the source for collecting and storing raw data

• Python – used for data cleaning, transformation, and basic processing

• Power BI – used for building the Market Intelligence dashboard

• n8n – used for pipeline orchestration (pipeline currently paused due to technical issues at the automation stage)

Current status:

The pipeline is partially implemented. Data extraction and processing were completed, and the final dashboard was built using the processed data. Automation via n8n is planned but temporarily halted.

Dashboard focus:

• Price overview (average, median, min, max)

• Location-wise price comparison

• Property distribution by number of bedrooms

• Average price per square foot

• Business-oriented insights rather than purely visual design

This project was done independently as part of learning data pipelines and analytics workflows.

* What parts gave you the most real security value (vs. just architecture purity or buzzwords)?
* Were there any Zero Trust patterns you tried that turned out to be overkill or created too much UX or operational pain?
* If you were evaluating a vendor like this, which concrete controls would convince you they “take Zero Trust seriously” versus just marketing it?

How can I create a validation tool that will flag each coding line on an export listing all the processed invoices and what they were coded to. That will flag it as correct coding or incorrect and why based on the ""rules""?

I made an excel template that for all intents and purposes works. But is inefficient and janky and slow because of the data ingestion method and so many formula interdependencies. Is has a ""master mapping"" page where it lists the correct combinations of coding, and uses Xlookups to see if a line on our processed invoices export is the found on the master mapping sheet, and flags it accordingly. But I don't know if there's a better way.

How would a data scientist/analyst approach this? Maybe a Python/Pandas/NumPy/Jupityr/etc. stack?

I'm not a data scientist, so please go easy on me!

1q9anqi,"For people at new or small startups, how do you manage version chaos on recurring monthly client dashboards?","For those of you doing any kind of recurring reporting or dashboards for clients or stakeholders, how are you keeping track of versions and feedback without losing your mind?

I worked at a small health insurance startup and we used SharePoint and Teams to track changes. The client success manager would log requests like ""change this color"" or ""this number looks off"" or ""add this metric"" and new changes would keep on being requested even after we thought a dashboard was done. Internal reviews kept getting rescheduled. It added up to hours of wasted time per week across multiple clients and recurring dashboards.

The worst part was that all that back and forth ate into time we needed for actual data work like scraping hundreds of PDFs and SQL extraction. The analyst I worked under was constantly stressed, working overtime, juggling 10 tickets while also having 2 dashboards due the same week that needed to be presented to leadership within days.

Curious if other small teams deal with this or if there's a workflow that actually keeps the revision chaos from snowballing. Or is this just the reality of early stage ops? ",1768067698.0,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/1q9anqi/for_people_at_new_or_small_startups_how_do_you/

1q8s0sq,Recurrent dashboard deliveries with tedious format change requests are so fucking annoying . Anyone else deal with this ?,"I’m an analyst and my team is already pretty overloaded. On top of regular tickets, we keep getting recurring requests to make tiny formatting changes to monthly client dashboards. Stuff like colors, fonts, spacing, or fixing one number.

Our workflow is building in Power BI, exporting to PowerPoint, uploading the PPT to SharePoint, then saving a final PDF and uploading that to another folder for review. The problem is Power BI exports to PPT as images, so every small change means re-exporting the entire deck. One minor request can turn into multiple re-exports.

When this happens across a bunch of clients every month, it adds up to hours of wasted time. Is anyone else dealing with this?

I think you can do a lot of your EDA stuff using SQL rather than using Python. But i mean how do real data scientsts and analysts working in companies use SQL and Python in the same project. It seems very vague to say that you can get the data you want using SQL and then python can handle the advanced ML , preprocessing stuff. If I was working in a company I would just fetch the data i want using SQL and do the analysis using Python , because with SQL i can't draw plots, do preprocessing. And all this stuff needs to be done simultaneously. I would just do some joins using SQl , get my data, and start with Python.

1q7dqqq,What AI tools are you actually using in your day-to-day data analytics workflow?,"Hi all,

I’m a data analyst working mostly with Power BI, SQL, and Python, and I’m trying to build a more “AI‑augmented” analytics workflow instead of just using ChatGPT on the side. I’d love to hear what’s *actually* working for you, not just buzzword tools.

A few areas I’m curious about:

* **AI inside BI tools**
   * Anyone actively using things like Power BI Copilot, Tableau AI / Tableau GPT, Qlik’s AI, ThoughtSpot, etc.?​
   * What’s genuinely useful (e.g., generating measures/SQL, auto-insights, natural-language Q&A) vs what you’ve turned off?
* **AI for Python / SQL workflows**
   * Has anyone used tools like PandasAI, DuckDB with an AI layer, PyCaret, Julius AI, or similar for faster EDA and modeling?​
   * Are text-to-SQL tools (BlazeSQL, built-in copilot in your DB/warehouse, etc.) reliable enough for production use, or just for quick drafts?​
* **AI-native analytics platforms**
   * Experiences with platforms like Briefer, [Fabi.ai](http://Fabi.ai), Supaboard, or other “AI-native” BI/analytics tools that combine SQL/Python with an embedded AI analyst?​
   * Do they actually reduce the time you spend on data prep and “explain this chart” requests from stakeholders?
* **Best use cases you’ve found**
   * Where has AI saved you *real* time? Examples: auto-documenting dashboards, generating data quality checks, root-cause analysis on KPIs, building draft decks, etc.​
   * Any horror stories where an AI tool hallucinated insights or produced wrong queries that slipped through?

Context on my setup:

* Stack: Power BI (DAX, Power Query), Azure (ADF/SQL/Databricks), Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL Server/Snowflake.​
* Typical work: dashboarding, customer/transaction analysis, ETL/data modeling, and ad-hoc deep dives.​

What I’m trying to optimize for is:

1. Less time on boilerplate (data prep, repetitive queries, documentation).
2. Faster, higher-quality exploratory analysis and “why did X change?” investigations.
3. Better explanations/insight summaries for non-technical stakeholders.

1q70o6r,Why raw web data is becoming a core input for modern analytics pipeline,"Over the past few years I’ve watched a steady shift in how analysts build their datasets. A few years ago the typical workflow started with a CSV export from an internal system, a quick clean‑up in Excel, and then the usual statistical modeling.

The driver behind this change is simple: the most current, granular information often lives on public websites, not in internal databases.

**Title:** Why raw web data is becoming a core input for modern analytics pipelines

Over the past few years I’ve watched a steady shift in how analysts build their datasets. A few years ago the typical workflow started with a CSV export from an internal system, a quick clean‑up in Excel, and then the usual statistical modeling. Today the first step for many projects is pulling data directly from the web—price feeds, product catalogs, public APIs, even social‑media comment streams.

The driver behind this change is simple: the most current, granular information often lives on public websites, not in internal databases. When you’re trying to forecast demand for a new product, for example, the price history of competing items on e‑commerce sites can be far more predictive than last year’s sales numbers alone. Similarly, sentiment analysis of forum discussions can surface emerging trends before they appear in formal market reports.

Getting that data, however, isn’t as straightforward as clicking “download”. Most modern sites render their content with JavaScript, paginate results behind “load more” buttons, or require authentication tokens that change every few minutes. Traditional spreadsheet functions like IMPORTXML or IMPORTHTML only see the static HTML returned by the server, so they return empty tables or incomplete data for these dynamic pages.

To reliably harvest the needed information you need a tool that can:

1. **Render the page in a real browser environment** – this ensures JavaScript‑generated content is fully loaded.
2. **Navigate pagination and follow links** – many listings span multiple pages; a headless‑browser approach can click “next” automatically.
3. **Schedule regular runs** – data freshness matters; a nightly job that writes directly into a Google Sheet or a database removes the manual copy‑paste step.

When these capabilities are combined, the result is a repeatable pipeline: the scraper runs in the cloud, extracts the structured data you need, and deposits it where your analysts can query it immediately. The pipeline can be monitored for failures, and you can add simple transformations (e.g., converting price strings to numbers) before the data lands in the sheet.

Because the extraction runs on a schedule, you also get a historical record automatically. Over time you build a time‑series of competitor prices, product releases, or any other metric that changes on the web. That historical depth is often the missing piece that turns a one‑off snapshot into a robust forecasting model.

In short, the modern data analyst’s toolkit now includes a reliable, no‑code web‑scraping layer that feeds fresh, structured data directly into the analysis workflow.

1q6ulku,I built an open-source library that diagnoses problems in your Scikit-learn models using LLMs,"Hey everyone, Happy New Year!

I spent the holidays working on a project I'd love to share: **sklearn-diagnose** — an open-source Scikit-learn compatible Python library that acts like an ""MRI scanner"" for your ML models.

**What it does:**

It uses LLM-powered agents to analyze your trained Scikit-learn models and automatically detect common failure modes:

\- Overfitting / Underfitting

\- High variance (unstable predictions across data splits)

\- Class imbalance issues

\- Feature redundancy

\- Label noise

\- Data leakage symptoms

Each diagnosis comes with confidence scores, severity ratings, and actionable recommendations.

**How it works:**

1. Signal extraction (deterministic metrics from your model/data)

2. Hypothesis generation (LLM detects failure modes)

3. Recommendation generation (LLM suggests fixes)

4. Summary generation (human-readable report)

**Links:**

\- GitHub: https://github.com/leockl/sklearn-diagnose

\- PyPI: pip install sklearn-diagnose

Built with LangChain 1.x. Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter as LLM backends.

Aiming for this library to be community-driven with ML/AI/Data Science communities to contribute and help shape the direction of this library as there are a lot more that can be built - for eg. AI-driven metric selection (ROC-AUC, F1-score etc.), AI-assisted feature engineering, Scikit-learn error message translator using AI and many more!
