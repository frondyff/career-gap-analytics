1qwqf0o,Looking for Retail Data Analysis Project Ideas / References,"Hi everyone,

I’m working on building a retail data analysis portfolio project and wanted to ask if anyone here has worked on or built a good retail analysis project that they’d be willing to share or let me refer to.

I’m mainly looking for project ideas, problem statements, datasets, or dashboards that reflect real-world retail use cases (sales analysis, customer behavior, inventory, forecasting, etc.).

Any links, GitHub repos, or brief descriptions would be really helpful.

Thank you in advance.. I would really appreciate your time and help! 😊",1770310029.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalytics/comments/1qwqf0o/looking_for_retail_data_analysis_project_ideas/
1qwntks,Angry analyst built a free data layer modeling tool after years of wrestling with 40‑page tracking docs – looking for feedback,"After enough projects where we debated attribution models and dashboards while working off inconsistent, poorly‑documented events, I realized my real anger was aimed at those monstrous Word files we used as tracking plans. Dozens of pages, different versions flying around, devs implementing from an old copy, analysts updating another, and endless Slack threads to reconcile what was “the latest.” It was slow, brittle, and made coordination with my analyst colleagues and stakeholders a constant headache.

That pushed me to treat data layer and event design as a first‑class artifact. I’ve built a tool that acts like a **schema designer for tracking**: you define events, properties, and entities in one place and export a structured data layer spec that can be implemented via GTM/GA4 or custom tracking. The goal is to make analytics requirements explicit, versionable, and shared, instead of buried in documents and email attachments.

A big part of what I’d like to build with this is **community‑driven templates**: common event models for e‑commerce, SaaS, content sites, etc., that we can improve together. The hope is that, as a community, we can converge on better naming, properties, and conventions rather than every team starting from scratch with a blank Word file.

The tool is free, and I genuinely want to keep it that way for as long as possible so analysts and smaller teams can use it without friction. If you find real value in it, a donation would be greatly appreciated to help keep it free and fund new features (better integrations, export formats, collaboration features, etc.).

I’m curious how people here think about this problem:

* Do you maintain a formal tracking plan / event catalog today, and how do you keep it synchronized across devs, analysts, and stakeholders?
* Would you like a similar tool for other kinds of documentation?
* Any pitfalls you’ve hit with enforcing conventions across multiple teams that I should consider while designing templates and workflows?

If you’re interested in this space, I’d be grateful if you’d take a look and share thoughts, **you can find the link the comments!**

Advice","Hi everyone,

  
Just a little bit about me. I recently graduated with a bachlor of science in computer science in December 2025. Currently pursung an MBA with a focus is data analytics. I have been pretty undecisive with my career direction for a bit of time now but finally have narrowed it down a little bit.

Out of most careers, data science/analytics has stuck out to me more than others and I have a strong interest to start a career. However, I am wondering if there are any certifications that would be useful or any suggestions for certificate programs? I am in the military, and we have funding for certifications but I don't want to waste the money on something that may not help me start a career.

1qsp0r8,“Learn Python” usually means very different things. This helped me understand it better.,"People often say *“learn Python”*.

What confused me early on was that Python isn’t one skill you finish. It’s a group of tools, each meant for a different kind of problem.

This image summarizes that idea well. I’ll add some context from how I’ve seen it used.

**Web scraping**  
This is Python interacting with websites.

Common tools:

* `requests` to fetch pages
* `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` to read HTML
* `Selenium` when sites behave like apps
* `Scrapy` for larger crawling jobs

Useful when data isn’t already in a file or database.

**Data manipulation**  
This shows up almost everywhere.

* `pandas` for tables and transformations
* `NumPy` for numerical work
* `SciPy` for scientific functions
* `Dask` / `Vaex` when datasets get large

When this part is shaky, everything downstream feels harder.

**Data visualization**  
Plots help you think, not just present.

* `matplotlib` for full control
* `seaborn` for patterns and distributions
* `plotly` / `bokeh` for interaction
* `altair` for clean, declarative charts

Bad plots hide problems. Good ones expose them early.

**Machine learning**  
This is where predictions and automation come in.

* `scikit-learn` for classical models
* `TensorFlow` / `PyTorch` for deep learning
* `Keras` for faster experiments

Models only behave well when the data work before them is solid.

**NLP**  
Text adds its own messiness.

* `NLTK` and `spaCy` for language processing
* `Gensim` for topics and embeddings
* `transformers` for modern language models

Understanding text is as much about context as code.

**Statistical analysis**  
This is where you check your assumptions.

* `statsmodels` for statistical tests
* `PyMC` / `PyStan` for probabilistic modeling
* `Pingouin` for cleaner statistical workflows

Statistics help you decide what to trust.

**Why this helped me**  
I stopped trying to “learn Python” all at once.

Instead, I focused on:

* What problem did I had
* Which layer did it belong to
* Which tool made sense there

That mental model made learning calmer and more practical.

Curious how others here approached this.

1qs9uow,Forward-Simulated Latent Stochastic Dynamical Systems for Longitudinal Failure Regimes,"I’ve been experimenting with whether synthetic data can encode failure as a dynamical outcome rather than a labeling rule. So, I built three open synthetic longitudinal datasets and posted them on Kaggle that were generated by forward-simulating latent dynamical systems, rather than fitting statistical templates or injecting noise into trends.

The motivation was to see whether synthetic data could encode failure as a dynamical outcome, not as a labeling rule.

The core idea is simple:

regimes (failure, burnout, collapse) emerge from dynamics, not from thresholds applied to labels.

Each system is modeled as a latent state vector \`x(t)\` evolving under coupled stochastic dynamics:

dx = f(x) dt + σ(x) dW

Observable variables are emitted \*downstream\* of these latent states, enforcing causal consistency and preventing physically or biologically impossible combinations.

\---

\## How the dynamics actually work

Across all datasets:

\* Latent state is integrated with RK4 for numerical stability over long horizons

\* Positive feedback loops drive acceleration near failure (e.g. wear ↑ → heat ↑ → wear ↑)

\* Hazard-based regime transitions use instantaneous hazard rates:

P(transition) = 1 - exp(-λ(x) Δt)

\* Once critical stress is exceeded, system parameters themselves change, suppressing recovery (hysteresis / scarring)

This makes recovery asymmetric: decline is fast, recovery is slow or incomplete.

\---

\## Datasets (very briefly)

Industrial Pump Failure

Latent wear, heat, and efficiency evolve as coupled SDEs.

Failure is a \*\*runaway instability\*\*, not a scripted endpoint.

Maintenance alters dynamics but never resets state.

\* 379k rows · 150 machines

\* \~0.1% failure, \~7% critical

\---

2) Human Performance &amp; Burnout

Fatigue and stress act as memory-bearing accumulators.

Burnout emerges when recovery capacity is exhausted; afterward, recovery elasticity is permanently reduced.

\* 975k rows · 140 agents

\* Stressed \~24.61%, Burnout \~1.8%, persistent once entered

\---

3) Ecological Stress &amp; Collapse

Interacting populations and resources under stochastic shocks.

After collapse, \*\*governing equations change\*\*, enforcing irreversibility.

\* 1.2M rows · 100 ecosystems

\* Collapse \~22%, stress window brief

Kaggle links are in a comment below for anyone who wants to explore the data.

1qs6c7n,How do I become job-ready after my MSc program?,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently a **first-year Data Management &amp; Analysis student** in a **1-year program**, and I recently transitioned from a **Biomedical Science background**. My goal is to move into **Data Science** after graduation.

I’m enjoying the program, but I’m struggling with the *pace and depth*. Most topics are introduced briefly and then we move on quickly, which makes it hard to feel confident or “industry ready.”

Some of the topics we cover include:

* Data preprocessing &amp; EDA
* Supervised Learning: Classification I (Decision Trees)
* Supervised Learning: Classification II (KNN, Naive Bayes)
* Supervised Learning: Regression
* Model Evaluation
* Unsupervised Learning: Clustering
* Text Mining

My concern is that while I understand the **theory**, I don’t feel like that alone will make me employable. I want to **practice the right way**, not just pass exams.

So I’m looking for advice from **working data analysts/scientists**:

* How would *you* practice these topics outside lectures?
* What should I be building alongside school (projects, portfolios, Kaggle, etc.)?
* How deep should I go into each model vs. focusing on fundamentals?
* What mistakes do students commonly make when trying to be “job ready”?
* Given my biomedical background, are there specific niches or project ideas I should lean into?

1qqvmlt,A visual summary of Python features that show up most in everyday code,"When people start learning Python, they often feel stuck.

Too many videos.  
Too many topics.  
No clear idea of what to focus on first.

This cheat sheet works because it shows the parts of Python you actually use when writing code.

A quick breakdown in plain terms:

**→ Basics and variables**  
You use these everywhere. Store values. Print results.  
If this feels shaky, everything else feels harder than it should.

**→ Data structures**  
Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries.  
Most real problems come down to choosing the right one.  
Pick the wrong structure and your code becomes messy fast.

**→ Conditionals**  
This is how Python makes decisions.  
Questions like:  
– Is this value valid?  
– Does this row meet my rule?

**→ Loops**  
Loops help you work with many things at once.  
Rows in a file. Items in a list.  
They save you from writing the same line again and again.

**→ Functions**  
This is where good habits start.  
Functions help you reuse logic and keep code readable.  
Almost every real project relies on them.

**→ Strings**  
Text shows up everywhere.  
Names, emails, file paths.  
Knowing how to handle text saves a lot of time.

**→ Built-ins and imports**  
Python already gives you powerful tools.  
You don’t need to reinvent them.  
You just need to know they exist.

**→ File handling**  
Real data lives in files.  
You read it, clean it, and write results back.  
This matters more than beginners usually realize.

**→ Classes**  
Not needed on day one.  
But seeing them early helps later.  
They’re just a way to group data and behavior together.

Don’t try to memorize this sheet.

Write small programs from it.  
Make mistakes.  
Fix them.

That’s when Python starts to feel normal.

Hope this helps someone who’s just starting out.

Do you really think you know how to work with AI?

Do you actually write good prompts?



Whether your answer is yes or no, here’s a solid tip.



Between **January 20 and March 2**, Microsoft is running the **Microsoft Credentials AI Challenge**.



This challenge is a Microsoft training program that combines **theoretical content and hands-on challenges**.

You’ll learn how to use AI the right way: how to build effective prompts, generate documents, review content, and work more productively with AI tools.



A lot of people use AI every day, but without really understanding what they’re doing — and that usually leads to poor or inconsistent results.

This challenge helps you build that foundation properly.



At the end, besides earning **Microsoft badges** to showcase your skills, you also get a **50% exam voucher** for Microsoft’s new AI certifications — which are much more practical and market-oriented.



These are **Microsoft Azure AI certifications** designed for real-world use cases.

Feels like each tool lives in its own little bubble, and I end up repeating context all the time.  
Workflows break, stuff gets duplicated, and instead of saving time it just slows me down.  
Was thinking, is there a ""Plaid for AI memory"" kind of thing? connect once, manage memory and permissions in one place.  
Like a single MCP server that holds shared memory so GPT knows what Claude knows and agents don't need to re-integrate.  
Seems like that could remove a ton of friction, but maybe I'm missing something.  
How are people handling this now? homebrew? some service I'm not aware of?  
Not sure how privacy and permissions would work though, that's my main worry.  
Anyway, curious if others feel the same or if I'm just overthinking it.",1769230347.0,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalytics/comments/1qldqcg/does_switching_between_ai_tools_feel_fragmented/
1qka0wi,"I audited an LLM’s ""thought process"" on Kaggle. Here is the SQL it ran to win.","I challenged an LLM Agent to solve the *Spaceship Titanic* Kaggle problem from scratch. 

**Result:** It hit the top 30% leaderboard in under 30 minutes.

But the score isn't the point. The point was that I could **see how the LLM went from data to results**.

With [Mantora](https://github.com/josephwibowo/mantora) capturing the session, the agent's strategy wasn't a mystery. I saw the exact SQL queries that led to its decisions, proving it wasn't hallucinating features, it was interviewing the data.

https://preview.redd.it/1y57k5rrgzeg1.png?width=3146&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1702fbc69299fc5ce2bdf2997542a04b5ba45bd

Here is the exact SQL evidence from the session receipt:

**1. It found the ""Golden Feature"" immediately.** I watched the agent run: SELECT CryoSleep, AVG(CAST(Transported AS INTEGER))... The result showed CryoSleep=True had an **81% transport rate** (vs 32% for False).

*Insight:* The agent didn't ""hallucinate"" that CryoSleep was important. It queried the stat, saw the 0.81 correlation, and locked it in as a primary feature.

**2. It engineered ""Spending"" behavior (Query #9)** It ran complex aggregations on 5 different spending columns (RoomService, Spa, VRDeck), splitting by Transported status. 

*Insight:* It discovered that transported passengers spent significantly less on luxury amenities (e.g., Avg Spa spend: **61** vs **564**).

**3. It discovered the ""Child"" anomaly (Query #10)** It didn't just look at raw age. It ran a CASE WHEN query to bucket passengers into groups (0-12, 13-19, etc).

*Insight:* It found that children (0-12) had a **69.9%** transport rate, significantly higher than any other age group.

If we are going to rely on LLMs to automate data science, we need the ability to audit their work just as we would a human peer. A flight recorder provides that necessary oversight, ensuring that as we delegate execution, we retain full visibility into the ""why"" behind the results. Trust requires evidence.

1qjv11p,CRM vs Data Analyst,"Hi everyone,

I’m currently at a crossroads in my career and would really appreciate some honest advice from people working in the field.

I recently finished a contract with the Portuguese Air Force, where I worked in Public Relations and content management. While I have solid experience in content creation and communication, I’ve realized that this is not the area I want to pursue professionally anymore.

I hold a Master’s degree in Data-Driven Marketing from NOVA IMS, with a specialization in CRM and Market Research. During the program, I had exposure to Big Data concepts, Python, Salesforce, and data analysis, although mostly at an academic level. I also have basic SQL skills, completed a Power BI course, and I’m considering taking the Microsoft Power BI certification in the coming months.

My medium-term goal is to work for a technology company like Microsoft, ideally in areas such as:

* Business Applications
* Customer Insights
* Data / Marketing Analytics

Right now, I’m unsure which path I should focus on:

**1) CRM / Customer Analytics**  
(Dynamics 365, Customer Insights, marketing automation, customer journeys)

**2) Data Analyst / BI**  
(Power BI, SQL, possibly Python later, dashboards, business insights)

My questions:

1. Based on your experience, which path offers better long-term career prospects?
2. Is a CRM-focused profile too niche, or is it actually an advantage when combined with data skills?
3. Is the Microsoft Power BI certification worth it in terms of employability?
4. If you were in my position today, what would you focus on in the next 6–12 months?

I’m not trying to become a data scientist overnight. I’m looking for a solid, realistic path that keeps doors open in tech and analytics.

Thanks in advance 🙏

*P.S.: I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Multimedia and two postgraduate diplomas — one in Digital Marketing and another in Branding &amp; Content Marketing.*",1769089808.0,7,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalytics/comments/1qjv11p/crm_vs_data_analyst/

The first thing I focused on was Pandas because I already knew the basics of Python. It took me about three weeks to become comfortable with Pandas, including understanding DataFrames and Series, core Pandas operations, data wrangling, and EDA. I also know how to customize charts and create visualizations using Seaborn. I don’t really like Matplotlib when making charts.

So, should I still improve my Pandas skills by learning more advanced topics, or is this a good point to stop and focus on other tools?

With recent market changes in the data pipeline space (e.g. Fivetran's recent acquisitions of dbt and SQLMesh) and the increased focus on AI rather than the fundamental tools that run global products, I'm doing a bit of open market research on identifying pain points in data pipelines – whether that's in build, deployment, debugging or elsewhere.

1qdvbet,"MS student graduating soon, resume review + career advice needed ,feeling stuck and anxious","Hello to who ever is reading this post,  
I need honest feedback on my resume because I genuinely don’t know if it’s good or bad anymore.

I’ve rewritten this resume so many times that I’ve completely lost perspective. Some days I feel like it’s solid and other days I look at it and feel like it’s probably the reason I’m not getting interviews.

I’ve tried to do all the “right” things. Keep it one page. Use impact and metrics. Focus on relevant experience and projects. Tailor it to analytics roles. Avoid fluff. Make it ATS friendly. And still, I’m barely getting callbacks, which makes me think something is wrong with how I’m presenting myself.

At this point I don’t even know what to improve. I don’t know if my bullets are too weak, if I’m underselling my experience, if my projects don’t sound impressive, or if the whole resume just doesn’t stand out at all. I also don’t know if I’m trying too hard to sound professional and ending up sounding generic.

I’m really looking for blunt, honest feedback. Not “this looks fine” but what actually needs to change. What looks bad. What looks confusing. What would make you pass if you were screening resumes. And what would actually make this resume stronger.

If you’ve reviewed resumes or hired for analytics or data roles, I’d especially appreciate your perspective. I’m open to rewriting entire sections if that’s what it takes. I just don’t want to keep applying with a resume that’s holding me back without realizing it.

I can share the resume if that helps. Thanks to anyone who takes the time to look or respond.",1768510061.0,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalytics/comments/1qdvbet/ms_student_graduating_soon_resume_review_career/

1q6q97u,Job market reality check: Europe / Canada vs Jordan for data &amp; analytics roles?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some honest perspectives on the job market in Europe (especially Spain/EU) and Canada compared to Jordan, particularly for roles in data, analytics, and data engineering.

For context:
I’m a Jordanian national with a BSc in Computer Science and currently working as a Data Engineer / IT Development Specialist in the compliance tech space (large-scale data ingestion, ETL pipelines, analytics, dashboards, etc.). I previously worked in information management and analytics for an international NGO. My work is very data-heavy and applied.

I’m currently applying for a Master’s in Big Data Analytics in Spain, and I want to be honest: the main motivation is seeking a better financial future and quality of life in the long term. While I’m grateful to be employed in Jordan, salaries, growth, and long-term financial security here feel very limited, even in technical roles.

My questions are:
	•	How realistic is it to break into the EU job market after a Master’s in Spain (as a non-EU citizen)?
	•	How does the salary vs cost of living actually compare to Jordan in practice (not just on paper)?
	•	Is Canada currently more realistic than Europe for tech/data roles, or is it equally saturated?
	•	For someone with experience (not entry-level), is the move “worth it” financially over a 5–10 year horizon?

I’m not expecting miracles, just trying to make an informed decision before committing time, money, and relocation. Any honest experiences — positive or negative — would be really appreciated.
