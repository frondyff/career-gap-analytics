1qwztq8,Snowflake native dbt question,"My organization that I work for is trying to move off of ADF and into Snowflake native dbt. Nobody at the org has really any experience in this, so I've been tasked to look into how do we make this possible.

Currently, our ADF setup uses templates that include a set of maintenance tasks such as row count checks, anomaly detection, and other general validation steps. Many of these responsibilities can be handled in dbt through tests and macros, and I’ve already implemented those pieces.

What I’d like to enable is a way for every new dbt project to automatically include these generic tests and macros—essentially a shared baseline that should apply to all dbt projects. The approach I’ve found in Snowflake’s documentation involves storing these templates in a GitHub repository and referencing that repo in dbt deps so new projects can pull them in as dependencies.

That said, we’ve run into an issue where the GitHub integration appears to require a username to be associated with the repository URL. It’s not yet clear whether we can supply a personal access token instead, which is something we’re currently investigating.

Given that limitation, I’m wondering if there’s a better or more standard way to achieve this pattern—centrally managed, reusable dbt tests and macros that can be easily consumed by all new dbt projects.",1770330535.0,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qwztq8/snowflake_native_dbt_question/
1qwx5xo,Fresher data engineer - need guidance on what to be careful about when in production,"Hi everyone,

I am junior data engineer at one of the MBB. it’s been a few moneths since I joined the workforce. There has been concerns raised on two projects i worked on that i use a lot of AI to write my code. i feel when it comes to production-grade code, i am still a noob and need help from AI. my reviews have been f\*\*ked because of using AI. I need guidance on what to be careful about when it comes to working in production environments. i feel youtube videos are not very production-friendly. I work on core data engineering and devops. Recently i learned about self-hosted and github hosted runners the hard way when i was trying to add Snyk into Github Actions in one of my project’s repository and i used youtube code and took help from AI which basically ran on github hosted runner instead of self hosted ones which I didn’t know about and it wasn’t clarified at any point of time that they have self hosted ones. This backfired on me and my stakeholders lost trust in my code and knowledge.

Asking for guidance and help from the experienced professionals here, what precautions(general or specific ones to your experience that you learned the hard way or are aware of) to take when working with production environments. need your guidance based on your experience so i don’t make such mistakes and not rely on AI’s half-baked suggestions.

1qwwgeo,Is a MIS a good foundation for DE?,"I just graduated with a Statistics major and Computer Programming minor. I'm currently self-learning working with APIs and data mining. I have done a lot of data cleaning and validating in my degree courses and own projects. I worked through the recent Databricks boot camp by Baraa which gave me some idea of what DE is like. The point is, from what I see and others tell, is that tools are easier to learn but the theory and thinking is key.

I'm fortunate enough to be able to pursue a MS and that's my goal. I wanted to hear y'all's thoughts on a Masters in Information Sciences. Specifically something like this: https://ecatalog.nccu.edu/preview\_program.php?catoid=34&poid=6710

My goal is to learn everything data related (DA, DS & DE). I can do analysis but no one's hiring and so it's difficult to get domain experience. I'm working on contacting local businesses and offering free data analysis services in the hopes of getting some useful experience. I'm learning a lot of the DS tools myself and I have the Statistics knowledge to back me but there's no entry-level DS anymore. DE is the only one that appears to be difficult to self-learn and relies on learning on the job which is why I'm thinking a MS that helps me with that is better than a MS in DS (which are mostly new and cash-grabs).

1qwn9ak,How do you document business logic in DBT ?,"Hi everyone, 

I have a question about business rules on DBT. It's pretty easy to document KPI or facts calculations as they are materialized by columns. In this case, you just have to add a description to the column. 

But what about filterng business logic ? 

  
Example: 

    # models/gold_top_sales.sql
    
    1 SELECT product_id, monthly_sales 
    2 FROM ref('bronze_monthly_sales') 
    3 WHERE country IN ('US', 'GB') AND category LIKE ""tech""

Where do you document this filter condition (line 3)?

For now I'm doing this in the YAML docs:

    version: 2
    models:
      - name: gold_top_sales
        description: |
          Monthly sales on our top countries and the top product catergory defined by business stakeholdes every 3 years.
          
          Filter: Include records where country is in the list of defined countries and category match the top product category selected.

1qwjl09,Data Lakehouse - Silver Layer Pattern,"Hi! I've been to several data warehousing projects lately, built with the ""medallion"" architecture and there are a few things which make me quite disturbed.

First - on all of these projects we were pushed by the ""data architect"" to use the Silver layer as a copy of the Bronze, only with SCD 2 logic on each table, leaving the original normalised table structure. No joining of tables, or other preparation of data allowed (the messy data preparation tables go to the Gold next to the star schema).

Second - it was decided, that all the tables and their columns are renamed to english (from Polish), which means that now we have three databases (Bronze, Silver and Gold), each with different names for the same columns and tables. Now when I get a SQL script with business logic from the analyst, I need to transcribe all the table and column names to the english (Silver layer) and then implement the transformation towards Gold. Whenever there is a discussion about the data logic, or I need to go back to the analyst with a question, I need to transpose all the english table&column names back to the Polish (Bronze) again. It's  time consuming. Then Gold has still different column names, as the star schema is adjusted to the reporting needs of the users.

Are you also experiencing this, is this some kind of a new trend? Would't it be so much easier to leave it with the original Polish names in the Silver, since there is no change to the data anyway and the lineage would be so much cleaner?

I understand the architects don't care what it takes to work with this as it's not their pain, but I don't understand that no one cares about the cost of this.. : D

Also I can see that people tend to think about the system as something developed once, not touching it afterwards. That goes completely against my experience. If the system is alive, then changes are required all the time, as the business evolves, which means the costs are heavily projecting to the future..

We have Postgres rds instances that we use fivetran to replicate from, but fivetran has been a rough experience - lots of recurring issues, fixing them usually requires support etc. 

We had a demo meeting with our databricks rep of lakeflow today, but it was a lot more code/manual setup than expected. We were expecting it to be a bit more out of the box, but the upside to that is we have more agency and control over issues and don’t have to wait on support tickets to fix. 

We are only 2 data engineers, (were 4 but layoffs) and I sort of sit between data eng and data science so I’m less capable than the other, who is the tech lead for the team. 

Has anyone had experience with lakeflow, both, made this switch etc that can speak to the overhead work and maintainability of lakeflow in this case?

1qw09c0,How do you handle *individual* performance KPIs for data engineers?,"Hello,

  
First off, I am not a data engineer, but more of like a PO/Technical PM for the data engineering team. 

I'm looking for some perspective from other DE teams...My leadership is asking my boss and I to define \*individual performance\* KPIs for data engineers. It is important to say they aren't looking for team level metrics. There is pressure to have something measurable and consistent across the team.

I know this is tough...I don't like it at all. I keep trying to steer it back to the TEAM's performance/delivery/whatever, but here we are. :(

One initial idea I had was tracking story points committed vs completed per sprint, but I'm concerned this doesn't map well to reality. Especially because points are team relative, work varies in complexity, and of course there are always interruptions/support work that can get unevenly distributed.

I've also suggested tracking cycle time trends per individual (but NOT comparisons...), and defining role specific KPIs, since not every single engineer does the same type of work.

Unfortunately leadership wants something more uniform and explicitly individual.

So I'm curious to know from DE or even leaders that browse this subreddit:

* if your org tracks individual performance KPIs for data engineers and data scientists, what does that actually look like?
   * what worked well? what backfired?

Any real world examples would be appreciated.

1qvoj0i,Financial engineering at its finest,"I’ve been spending time lately looking into how big tech companies use specific phrasing to mask (or highlight) their updates, especially with all the chip investment deals going on. 

Earlier this week, I was going through the Microsoft earnings call transcript and (based on what seems like shared sentiment in the market), I was curious how Fabric was represented. From my armchair analyst position, its adoption just doesn’t seem to line up with what I assumed would exist by now...

On the recent FY26 Q2 call, Satya said:

>Two years since it became broadly available, Fabric's annual revenue run rate is now over $2 billion with over 31,000 customers... revenue up 60% year over year.

The first thing that made me skeptical is the type of metrics used for Fabric. “Annual revenue run rate” is NOT the same as “we actually generated $2B over the last 12 months.” This is super normal when startups report earnings, since if a product is growing, run rate can look great even when realized trailing revenue is still catching up. Microsoft chose run rate wording here.

Then I looked at the previous earnings where Fabric was discussed. In FY25 Q3, they said Fabric had 21k paid customers and “40% using Real-Time Intelligence” five months after GA, but “using” isn’t defined in a way that’s tangible, which usually is telling. In last week’s earnings, Satya immediately discusses specific metrics, customer references, etc. for other products.

A huge part of why I’m also not convinced on adoption is because of the forced Power BI capacity migration. I know the world is all about financial engineering, and since Microsoft forced us all to migrate off of P-SKUs, it’s not hard to advertise those numbers as great. The conspiracist in me says the numbers line up a little too neatly with the SKU migration:

* $2B in revenue run rate / 31,000 customers ≈ $64.5k per customer per year. 
* That’s conveniently right around the published price of an F64 reservation

Obviously an average is oversimplifying it, and I don’t think Microsoft is lying about the metrics whatsoever, but I do think the phrasing doesn’t line up with the marketing and what my account team says…

The other thing I saw was how Microsoft talks when they have deeper adoption. They normally use harder metrics like customers >$1M, big deployments, customer references, etc. In the same FY26 Q2 transcript, Fabric gets the run-rate/customer count and then the conversation moves on. And that’s it. After that, I was surprised that Fabric was never mentioned on its own again, nor expanded upon, and outside of that sentence, Fabric was always mentioned with Foundry.

Earnings reports aren't everything, and 31,000 customers is a lot, so I went looking for proof in customer stories, and the majority of the stories are just implementation partners and consultancies whose practices depend on selling Fabric (Boutiques/Avanade types), not a flood of end-customer production migrations with scale numbers. (There are are a couple of enterprise stories like LSEG and Microsoft’s internal team, but it doesn’t feel like “no shortage.”)

Please check me. Am I off base here? Or is the growth just because of the forced migration from Power BI?

I'm a senior business analyst now. I have comfortable job currently on pretty much every level. I could stay here until I retire. Legacy company, cool people, very nice atmosphere, I do well, team is good, boss values my work, no rush, no stress, you get the drift. The job itself however has become very boring. The most pleasant part of the work is unnecessary (front end) so I'm left with same stuff over and over again, pumping quite simple reports wondering if end users actually get something out of them or not. Plus the salary could be a bit higher (it's always the case) but objectively it is OK.

So here I am, getting this scary thoughts that... this is it for me. That I could just coast here until I get old. I'd miss better jobs, better money, better life.

So

The most ""smooth"" transition path for me would to break into data engineering. It seems logical, probable and interesting to me. Sometimes I read what other people do as DE and I simply get jealous. It just seems way more important, more technology based, better learning experience, better salaries, and just more serious job so to speak.

* Tech is moving forward
* AI can write code in seconds that it would take me some time to learn
* Juniors DE seem to be obsolete cause mids can do their job as well Seniors DE are even more efficient now

* What kind of Data Tech Stack would be most appropriate (Open Source, Cloud Services, or Hybrid)?
* For a Data Orchestrator, is a code-based approach (such as Dagster or Airflow) or a GUI-based approach (such as SSIS) better in the long run, especially if the Data Engineering team needs to scale?
* What roles should exist within a Data Engineering team (e.g., Lead, Infrastructure, Operational Service), or is it actually unnecessary to divide the team into sub-roles?
* How should we choose Data Storage to suit each layer? Is it necessary to use newer technologies (such as Data Warehouse or Data Lakehouse), or should we choose based on the expertise of the organization’s IT department, which is likely more familiar with OLTP databases?
* For a Data Dictionary, should it be embedded directly into table names for convenience, documented separately, or handled through a dedicated platform (such as DataHub)?
* To comply with PDPA / security audits, should data be masked or encrypted before it reaches the data storage that the Data Engineering team has access to? And which department in the organization is typically responsible for this?
* As someone who can be considered a new Data Engineer, could you please recommend skills that I should learn or further develop?

Lastly, if there are any parts of my questions where I used incorrect terminology or misunderstood certain concepts, please feel free to point them out and explain. I’m still not fully confident in my understanding of this field.

Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to share their opinions and advice.

1qv74oi,Not providing schema evolution in bronze,"We are giving a client an option for schema evolution in bronze, but they aren't having it.  Risk and cost is their concern.  It will take a bit more effort to design, build, and test the ingestion into bronze with schema drift/evolution.

Although implementing schema-evolution isn't a big deal, a more controlled approach to new columns still provides a viable trade off.

I'm looking at some different options to mitigate it.

We'll enforce schema (for the standard included fields) and ignore any new fields.  The source database is a production RDBMs, so ingesting RDMBS change tracking rows into bronze (append only) is going to really be valuable to the client.  However, the client is aware that they won't be getting new columns automatically.

We're approaching new columns like a change request.  If they want them in the data platform, we need to include into bronze first, then update the model in silver and then gold.

To approach it, we'd get the new field they want; include it into the ETL pipeline.  We'd also have to execute a one-off pipeline that would write all records for the table into bronze where there was a non-null value for that new field as a 'change' record first.

Then we turn on the ETL pipeline, and life continues on as normal and bronze is up to date with the new column.

Thoughts?  Would you approach it differently?",1770159323.0,1,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qv74oi/not_providing_schema_evolution_in_bronze/

1qv3q0b,Column-level lineage for 50K+ Snowflake tables (Solving problems to make new problems),"Been building lineage systems for the past 3 years. Table-level lineage is basically useless for actual debugging work. I wanted to share some things I learned getting to column-level at scale.

**My main problem**

Someone changes a column in a source table. Which downstream dashboards break Table-level lineage says ""everything connected to this table"" (useless, 200 false positives). Column-level says ""these 3 specific dashboard fields"", which is actually helpful.

**What didn't work**

**My first attempt: Regex parsing SQL**

Wrote a bunch of regex to pull column names from SELECT statements. Worked for simple queries. Completely fell apart with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.

Example that broke it:

    WITH customers AS (
      SELECT 
        c.id as customer_key,
        c.email as contact_email
      FROM raw.customers c
    )
    SELECT customer_key, contact_email FROM customers

My regex couldn't track that customer\_key came from c.id. I gave up after 2 weeks.

**My 2nd attempt: Query INFORMATION\_SCHEMA only**

Thought we could just use Snowflake's metadata tables to see column relationships. **Nope**. INFORMATION\_SCHEMA tells you schemas exist, not how data flows through queries.

I found success by parsing SQL properly with an actual parser, not regex. I used sqlparse for Python but JSQLParser works if you live in Java world.

Query Snowflake's QUERY\_HISTORY view, parse every SELECT/INSERT/CREATE TABLE AS statement, build a graph of column → column relationships.

**The architecture**

    Snowflake QUERY_HISTORY 
      ↓
    Extract SQL (last 7 days of queries)
      ↓
    SQL Parser (sqlparse)
      ↓
    Column Mapper (track renames/transforms)
      ↓
    Graph DB (Neo4j) + Search (Elasticsearch)

    import sqlparse
    from snowflake.connector import connect
    
    # Pull recent queries
    queries = snowflake.execute(""""""
      SELECT query_text 
      FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.QUERY_HISTORY 
      WHERE query_type IN ('SELECT', 'INSERT', 'CREATE_TABLE_AS_SELECT')
      AND start_time > DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
    """""")
    
    for query_text in queries:
        parsed = sqlparse.parse(query_text)[0]
        
        # Extract SELECT columns
        select_cols = extract_columns(parsed)
        
        # Extract FROM tables and resolve schemas
        source_tables = extract_tables(parsed)
        
        # Handle SELECT * by querying schema
        if has_star_select(select_cols):
            select_cols = resolve_star_expressions(source_tables)
        
        # Build edges: source_col -> output_col
        for output_col in select_cols:
            for input_col in output_col.dependencies:
                graph.add_edge(
                    from_col=f""{input_col.table}.{input_col.name}"",
                    to_col=f""{output_col.table}.{output_col.name}"",
                    transform_type=output_col.transform
                )

**Some issues I ran into**

**1. SELECT \* resolution**

When you see SELECT \* FROM customers JOIN orders, you need to know what columns exist in both tables at query execution time. Can't parse this statically.

The solution is to Query INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.COLUMNS to get table schemas, then expand \* to the actual column list.

**2. Column aliasing chains**

    SELECT 
      customer_id as c_id,
      c_id as cust_id,  -- references the alias above
      cust_id as final_id

You have to track the alias chain through the entire query. The symbol table gets really messy really fast.

**3. Subqueries and CTEs**

Each level of nesting creates a new namespace. The parser needs to track which customer\_id is which when you have 3 nested CTEs all selecting customer\_id.

**4. Window functions and aggregates**

SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY customer\_id) means the output column depends on revenue (for the calculation) and customer\_id (for the partition), but differently.

Your lineage graph needs different edge types: ""aggregates,"" ""partitions\_by,"" ""direct\_reference.""

**Performance at 50K tables**

Parsing 7 days of query history (about 500K queries): 2 hours  
Storage: Neo4j graph (200M edges), Elasticsearch (column name search)  
Query time: ""Show me everything downstream of this column"" = sub-2 seconds  
Query time: ""Where is customer\_id used?"" = sub-1 second

To save yourself a future headache, save the 20% of lineage paths that get queried 80% of the time.

**What I’m still struggle with**

Cross-warehouse lineage. My data flows Snowflake → Databricks → back to Snowflake. This approach only sees the Snowflake side.

Real-time updates. I run lineage extraction every 6 hours. If someone on my team changes a column and immediately asks ""what breaks?"", they get stale data.

ML pipelines. Notebooks that do df.select(""customer\_id"") don't show up in Snowflake query logs. That’s a blind spot.

What's your current table count? Curious where others hit the breaking point. Sorry for the wall of text!",1770151598.0,26,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qv3q0b/columnlevel_lineage_for_50k_snowflake_tables/
1qv0iyl,DoorDash Sr Data Engineer,"Recently interviewed at DoorDash. 

Onsite had 4 rounds System Design, Data Modeling, Business Partner and Leadership 

The recruiter who had reached out regarding the role had transferred my profile to other recruiter at onsite process. 

This new recruiter , not friendly. In a cold email said that I should book time on her calendar for a prep call. Well there was not a single slot available for next 3 weeks. I kept checking for couple of days and finally found one. On the day of call she rescheduled for different time. On the call read the same pdf that she had shared with me over the email on what to expect. Not a great conversation. I’ve  met really good recruiters who are friendly enough. 

System Design question - question was quite big 6-7 lines. I’ll put it in simple words - Design DataBricks! Yes, you read it right! Interviewer was interested in knowing how will I write exact YAML code for this. I was able to answer all his questions.

Data Modeling - Design fitness app. But the interviewer wanted me to draw visualizations. Well never in my past 8 years of work experience I had to do any visualizations but looks like DE in DoorDash work on visualizations as well. It wasn’t a basic graph , some advanced trend graph. 

Business Partner - DoorDash expanding business how will you go about it etc. basic questions interviewer also seem to be onboarded on the approaches

Leadership - Hiring Manager joined 2-3 minutes late. Didn’t bother to apologize. I ignored that and continued to talk with my positive energy. He said he will leave 10 minutes at the end for me to ask any questions. 

Questions were normal tell me about the time kind. Situation based. I answered all. He had multiple follow up questions. Kept asking something from the list. It was almost 5 minutes to end the meeting and then he stopped and started sharing about the team. Even here he didn’t ask if I have any questions. I had to ask him when we were at time if I can ask couple of questions. I felt like I performed well.

1quz6kq,Looking for feedback on a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language,"I built BigAsk, a self-deployed web interface for exploring BigQuery data by asking questions in natural language. It’s a fairly thin wrapper over the Gemini CLI meant to address some shortcomings it has in overcoming data querying challenges organizations face.

I’m a Software Engineer in infra/DevOps, but I have a few friends who work in roles where much of their time is spent fulfilling requests to fetch data from internal databases. I’ve heard it described as a “necessary evil” of their job which isn’t very fulfilling to perform. Recently, Google has released some quite capable tools with the potential to enable those without technical experience using BigQuery to explore the data themselves, both for questions intended to return exact query results, and higher-level questions about more nebulous insights that can be gleaned from data. While these certainly wouldn’t completely eliminate the need for human experts to write some queries or validate results of important ones, it seems to me like they could significantly empower many to save time and get faster answers.

Unfortunately, there are some pretty big limitations to the current offerings from Google that prevent them from actually enabling this empowerment, and this project seeks to fix them.

One is that the best tools are available in a limited set of interfaces. Those scattered throughout the already-lacking-in-user-friendliness BigQuery UI require some foundational BigQuery and data analysis skills to use, making their barrier to entry too high for many who could benefit from them. The most advanced features are only available in the Gemini CLI, but as a CLI, using it requires using a command-line, again putting it out-of-reach for many.

The second is a lack of safe access control. There's a reason BigQuery access is typically limited to a small group. Directly authorizing access to this data via the BigQuery UI or Gemini CLI to individual users who aren't well-versed in its stewardship carries large risks of data deletion or leaks. As someone with experience working professionally with managing cloud IAM within an organization, I know that attempts to distribute permissions to individual users while maintaining a limited scope on them also requires considerable maintenance overhead and comes with it’s own set of security risks.

BigAsk enables anyone within an organization to easily and securely use the most powerful agentic data analysis tools available from Google to self-serve answers to their burning questions. It addresses the problems outlined above with a user-friendly web interface, centralized access management with a recommended permissions set, and simple, lightweight code and deployment instructions that can easily be extended or customized to deploy into the constraints of an existing Google Cloud project architecture.

1quxzvb,Are Python UDFs in Spark still less efficient than UDFs written in Scala or Java?,"I'm reading ""Spark: The Definitive"" guide and there's a part about how user defined functions in Python can be inefficient. This is the quote: 

""When you use the function, there are essentially two different things that occur. If the function is written in Scala or Java, you can use it within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means that there will be little performance penalty aside from the fact that you can’t take advantage of code generation capabilities that Spark has for builtin functions. There can be performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects; we cover that in the section on optimization in Chapter 19. 

If the function is written in Python, something quite different happens. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand (remember, it was in the JVM earlier), executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process, and then finally returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.

Starting this Python process is expensive, but the real cost is in serializing the data to Python. This is costly for two reasons: it is an expensive computation, but also, after the data enters Python, Spark cannot manage the memory of the worker. This means that you could potentially cause a worker to fail if it becomes resource constrained (because both the JVM and Python are competing for memory on the same machine). We recommend that you write your UDFs in Scala or Java—the small amount of time it should take you to write the function in Scala will always yield significant speed ups, and on top of that, you can still use the function from Python!"" 

I heard from Reddit that this book was written a long time ago and some things may be outdated. Is this still relevant with the latest versions of Spark? Are Python UDFs still significantly slower than Scala/Java UDFs in Spark? If yes, have you ever encountered a situation at work where someone actually wrote a UDF in Scala or Java and avoided using Python for the sake of performance increases?",1770139205.0,33,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1quxzvb/are_python_udfs_in_spark_still_less_efficient/

1quu6j3,"Weird position, don't know where to go from here","I am on an integration pipeline and manage the repo for it. I inherited it and made some slight tweaks but did not make the system from scratch. Its really a one way integration between two OLTP systems where webhook from System A writes to apigw which routes to a lambda which writes to dynamo where another lambda on a schedule reads from dynamo and writes unprocessed records to System B. There's also another flow where we have a lamdba check System B to see if users have a token and if if they don't, the lambda writes them to SQS where we have another lambda batch from SQS, grab a token from System A and write them back to users in System B.

Its my first real pipeline as a ""Data Engineer"" but it feels like integration engineering not DE. It gets slightly more DE related where we are landing that same webhook data into S3 and materializing it in Redshift for downstream analysis.

1qunhxb,Switching from Data Science to Data Engineering,"Hi everyone, I'm currently working in a data science role but was thinking about making the switch to data engineering. I have a background in statistics and have been working as a data scientist in biomedical research in academia for 1.5 years. This is my first job since finishing my Masters in statistics. When I first started the job, I was responsible for cleaning datasets from clinical trials (this was 90% of the work), statistical modeling, creating visual aids like graphs and charts, and presenting and explaining my work to biologists. After 6 months, my manager told me I ""wasn't a good fit"" for the role because I ""lack curiosity"". I wouldn't say he was wrong. I didn't mind the work but it also didn't excite me and I didn't find it that fulfilling.

I was transferred to a different team within the same company and my main project became writing programming scripts to automate compression of thousands of files from patient databases, and creating lookup tables containing information on all the files (such as patient identifiers, visit dates, etc.) This involved a lot of identifying and sometimes renaming files that were mislabeled, had missing information, or used different naming conventions, and make sure these edge cases were accounted for in the compression process. We also received multiple batches of files from different sources, and I had to modify the scripts to account for all the nuances between different sources. 

I noticed I enjoyed these projects much more and that I'm very precise and good at paying close attention to small details. I liked how expectations were more well-defined with this project and was more like ""it either works or it doesn't"", rather than the previous data science role which was much more open-ended. I feel like I do better when expectations are more structured and consistent, rather than exploratory. My new manager also noticed the new role was a much better fit for me.

That being said, I'm thinking about pivoting into data engineering for my next role because I feel it may be a better fit for me. I've been looking at job postings for data engineering roles, but I don't have many of the skills required for a lot of these roles. My work so far has mainly been in R since that's what my company uses, and I've had some exposure to SQL and Python. I know Python and SQL are important in data engineering and tech is all about transferable skills, but I feel like I don't yet have the toolbox to switch to data engineering, nor do I have strong software engineering skills. I'm also not sure if I will be a strong candidate considering how competitive the job market is nowadays. My plan for now is to learn the important skills so that I'm able to make the switch.

Those of you who switched from data science to data engineering, what was your experience like and how did you navigate that shift? What are the most important data engineering skills/tools I should familiarize myself with to become a competitive candidate and be ready for interviews? What are some good resources you would suggest for learning these skills/tools? And do you have any general advice for me?

1qukzhw,I'm building a CLI tool for data diffing,"https://preview.redd.it/ves9ksnz78hg1.png?width=2198&format=png&auto=webp&s=3db49b5c320d0e332b3dca2230d81f330dbafee5

I'm building a simple CLI tool called **tablediff** that allows to quickly perform a data diffing between two tables and print a nice summary of findings.

It works cross-database and also on CSV files (dunno, just in case). Also, there is a mode that allows to only compare schemas (useful to cross-check tables in DWH with their counterparts in the backend DB).

My main focus is usability and informative summary.

You can try it with:

    pip install tablediff-cli[snowflake] # or whatever adapter you need

Usage is straightforward:

    tablediff compare \
      TABLE_A \
      TABLE_B \
      --pk PRIMARY_KEY \
      --conn CONNECTION_STRING
      [--conn2 ...]        # secondary DB connection if needed
      [--extended]         # for extended output
      [--where ""age > 18""] # additional WHERE condition

Let me know what you think.

1qu57bm,Modeling 1: N relationships for Tableau Consumption,"Hi all, 

How would you all model a 1: N relationship in a SQL Data Mart to streamline the consumption for Tableau? 

My organization is debating this topic internally and we haven't reached an agreement so far. 

A hypothetical use case is our service data. One service can be attached to multiple account codes (and can be offered in multiple branches as well).  

Here are the options for the data mart.  

**Option A:** Basically, the 3NF

https://preview.redd.it/dazl3okpv4hg1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=1132687320f4ff596da43013f4de98559be88eb2

**Option B:**

A simple bridge table 

https://preview.redd.it/jbs1f86sv4hg1.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb085c6801f03fa8e68c0ce35264fcc986c41eea

**Option C:** A derivation of the [i2b2 model](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Ontology-driven-data-transformation-in-i2b2-The-ontology-which-defines-concept-metadata_fig1_331215339) ([4. Tutorials: Using the i2b2 CDM - Bundles and CDM - i2b2 Community Wiki](https://community.i2b2.org/wiki/display/BUN/4.+Tutorials%3A+Using+the+i2b2+CDM))  

In this case, all 1:N relationships (account code, branches, etc) would be stored at the concept table

[](https://i.redd.it/k0dqbwblu4hg1.png)

**Option D:**

Denormalized

[](https://i.redd.it/c6k0gj2nu4hg1.png)

*What's the use case for reporting?*

 The main one would be to generate tabular data through Tableau such as the example below and be able to filter it through a specific field (service name, account code). 

Down the line, there would also be some reports of how many clients were serviced by each serviced or the budget/expense amount for each account code  

 

Example:

I acknowledge that not being able to finish in time could mean that I am may not be qualified for the role but I also think that once on the job, the timed aspect is not as severe due to other factors like being more comfortable with the schemas, and business sense.

I know the job market is tough, but this is not what I'm asking about. How can I be more efficient in these screens? I've tried LeetCode and other things but the structure of the questions don't tend to match or are not as useful.

1qtfbhx,Architecting a realtor analytics system,"Junior Engineer here. I have been tasked with designing a scalable and flexible analytics architecture that shows you realtors performance in different US markets. 

What we need: 

Show aggregated realtor performance (volume sold based on listing/buying side) on different filters like at the state level, county level, zip level, MLS level) and a user can set a date range. This performance needs to be further aggregated together at office level so we can bring out stuff top agents per office.

I currently use 3 datasets (listings, tax/assessor, office data) to create one giant fact table that contains agent performance in the areas I mentioned above aggregated on the year and the month. So I can query the table to find out how a certain agent performed in a certain zip code compared to some other agent, or I can see an agents most sold areas, average listing price etc. 


The Challenge

1) Right now the main issue we are facing is the speed.

The table I made is sitting inside snowflake, and the frontend uses a aws lambda to fetch the data from snowflake. This adds some latency (authentication alone takes 3 seconds) and warehouse startup time + query execution time) and the whole package comes to around 8 seconds. We would ideally want to do this under 2 seconds. 

We had a senior data engineer who designed a sparse GSI schema for dynamodb where the agent metrics were dimensionalized such that i can query a specific GSI to see how an  agent ranks on a leader board for a specific zip code/state/county etc. This architecture presents the problem that we can only compare agents based on 1 dimension. (We trade flexibility over speed). However, we want to be able to filter on multiple filters.

I have been trying to design a similar leader board schema but to be used on OpenSearch, but there's a 2nd problem that I also want to keep in mind.

2) Adding additional datasets in the future 

Right now we are using 3 datasets, but in the future we will likely need to connect more data (like mortgage) with this. As such, I want to design an opensearch schema that allows me to aggregate performance metrics, as well as leave space to add more datasets and their metrics in the future. 

What I am looking for:

I would like to have tips from experienced Data Engineers here who have worked on similar projects like this. I would love any tips on pitfalls/things to avoid and what to think about when designing this schema.

1qteway,"[Project] I built a CLI to find ""Zombie Vectors"" in Pinecone/Weaviate (and estimate how much RAM you're wasting)","Hey everyone,

I’m an ex-AWS S3 engineer. In my previous life, we obsessed over ""Lifecycle Policies"" because storing petabytes of data is expensive. If data wasn’t touched in 30 days, we moved it to cold storage.

I noticed a weird pattern in the AI space recently: **We are treating Vector Databases like cold storage.**

We shove 100% of our embeddings into expensive Hot RAM (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate), even though for many use cases (like Chat History or Seasonal Catalog Search), 90% of that data is rarely queried after a month. It’s like keeping your tax returns from 1990 in your wallet instead of a filing cabinet.

I wanted to see exactly how much money was being wasted, so I wrote a simple open-source CLI tool to audit this.

**What it does:**

1. **Connects** to your index (Pinecone currently supported).
2. **Probes** random sectors of your vector space to sample metadata.
3. **Analyzes** the `created_at` or timestamp fields.
4. **Reports** your ""Stale Rate"" (e.g., ""65% of your vectors haven't been queried in >30 days"") and calculates potential savings if you moved them to S3/Disk.

**The ""Trust"" Part:** I know giving API keys to random tools is a bad idea.

* This script runs **100% locally** on your machine.
* Your keys never leave your terminal.
* You can audit the code yourself (it’s just Python).

**Why I built this:** I’m working on a larger library to automate the ""S3 Offloading"" process, but first I wanted to prove that the problem actually exists.

I’d love for you to run it and let me know: **Does your stale rate match what you expected?** I’m seeing \~90% staleness for Chat Apps and \~15% for Knowledge Bases.

1qtdnvi,What are the scenarios where we DON'T need to build a dimensional model?,"As title.  **When** ***shouldn't*** **we go through the efforts of building a dimensional model?**  To me, it's a bit of a grey area.  But how do I pick out the black and white?  When I'm giving feedback, questioning and making suggestions about the aspects of the design as developed - and it's not a dim model - I'll tend to default to ""should be a dim model"".  I'm concerned that's a rigid and incorrect stance.  I'm vaguely aware that a dim model is not always the way to go, but *when is that?*

Background:  I have 7 years in DE, 3 years before that in SW.  I've learned a bunch, but often fall back on what are considered best practices if I lack the depth or breadth of experience.  When, and when *not* to use a dim model is one of these areas.

Most our use cases are A) Reports in Power BI.  Occasionally, B) Returning specific, flat information.  For B, it could *still* come from a dim model.  This leads me to think that a dim model is a go-to, with doing otherwise is the exception.

Problem of the day: There's a repeating theme at work.  Models put together by a colleague are never strict dims/facts.  It's *relational*, so there is a logical star, but it's not as clear-cut as a few facts and their dimensions.  Measures and attributes remain mixed.  They'll often say that the data and/or model is small: there is a handful of tables; less than hundreds of millions of rows.

I get the balance between *ship now* and *do it properly, methodically, follow a pattern*.  But, whether there are 5 tables or 50, I am stuck on the thought that your 5-table data source *still* has some business process to be considered.  There are *still* measures and attributes to break out.

1qtc0ag,Recommended ETL pattern for reference data?,"Hi all,

I have inherited a pipeline where some of the inputs are reference data that are uploaded by analysts via CSV files.

The current ingestion design for these is quite inflexible. The reference data is tied to a year dimension, but the way things have been set up is that the analyst needs to include the year which the data is for in the filename. So, you need one CSV for every year that there is data for.

e.g. we have two CSV files, the first is *some\_data\_2024.csv* which would have contents:

|id|foo|
|:-|:-|
|1|423|
|2|1|

the second is *some\_data\_2021.csv* which would have contents:

|id|foo|
|:-|:-|
|1|13|
|2|10|

These would then appear in the final silver table as 4 rows:

|year|id|foo|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2024|1|423|
|2024|2|1|
|2021|1|13|
|2021|2|10|

Which means that to upload many years' worth of data, you have to create and upload many CSV files all named after the year they belong to. I find this approach pretty convoluted. There is also no way to delete a bad record unless you replace it. (It can't be removed entirely).

Now the pattern I want to go to is just allow the analysts to upload a singular CSV file with a year column. Whatever is in there will be what is in the final downstream table. In other words, the third table above will be what they upload. If they want to remove a record just reupload that singular CSV without that record. I figure this is much simpler. I will have a staging table that captures the entire upload history and then the final silver table just selecting all records from the latest upload.

What do we think? Please let me know if I should add more details.",1769982756.0,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qtc0ag/recommended_etl_pattern_for_reference_data/

1qt1543,Handling spark failures,"Recently I've been working on deploying some spark jobs in Amazon eks, the thing is sometimes they just fail intermittently for 4/5 runs continuously due to some issues like executors getting killed/ shuffle partitions lost.. ( I can go on and list the issues but you got the idea ). Right now I'm just either increasing resources or modifying some of the spark properties like increasing shuffle partitions and stuff. 

I've gone through couple of videos/articles, most of them fit well in theory for small scale processing but don't think they would be able to handle heavy shuffle involved ingestions.

Are there any resources where I can learn how to handle such failures with proper reasoning on how/why do we add some specific spark properties?",1769959127.0,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qt1543/handling_spark_failures/

1qsg6tc,Puzzle game to learn Apache Spark & Distributed Computing concepts,"https://i.redd.it/fsa3dtvkfrgg1.gif

Hello all!

I'm new in this subreddit! I'm a Data Engineer with +3 years of experience in the field.

As shown in the attached image, I'm making an ETL simulator in JavaScript, that simulates the data flow in a pipeline.

Recently I came across a Linkedin post of a guy showcasing this project : [https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival](https://github.com/pshenok/server-survival)

He made a little tower defense game that interactively teaches Cloud Architecture basics.

It was interesting to see the engagement of the DevOps community with the project. Many have starred and contributed to the Github repo.

I'm thinking about building something silimar for Data Engineers, given that I have some background in Game Dev and UI/UX too. I still need your opinion though, to see whether or not it is going to be that useful, especially that it will take some effort to come up with something polished, and AI can't help much with that (I'm coding all of the logic manually).

The idea is that I want to make it easy to learn Apache Spark internals and distributed computing principles. I noticed that many Data Engineers (at least here in France), including seniors/experts, say they know how to use Apache Spark, yet they don't deeply understand what's happening under the hood.

Through this game, I'll try to concretize the abstract concepts and show how they impact the execution performance, such as : transformations/actions, wide/narrow transformations, shuffles, repartition/coalesce, partitions skew, spills, node failures, predicate pushdown, ...etc

You'll be able to build pipelines by stacking transformer blocks. The challenge will be to produce a given dataframe using the provided data sources, while avoiding performance killers and node failures. In the animated image above, the sample pipeline is equivalent to the following Spark line : `new_df = source_df.filter($""shape"" === ""star"").withColumn(""color"", lit(""orange""))`

I represented the rows with shapes. The dataframe schema will remain static (shape, color, label) and the rendering of each shape reflects the content of the row it represents. Dataframe here is a set of shapes.

I'm still hesitant about this representation. Do you think it is intuitive and easy to understand ? I can always revert to the standard tabular visualisation of rows with dynamic schemas, but I guess it won't look user friendly when there are a lot of rows in action.

The next step will be to add logical multi-node clusters in order to simulate the distributed computing. The heaviest task that I estimated would be the implementation of the data shuffling.

I'll share the source code within the next few days, the project needs some final cleanups.

In the meanwhile, feel free to comment or share anything helpful :)",1769898097.0,64,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qsg6tc/puzzle_game_to_learn_apache_spark_distributed/

1qsaom3,Looking for advice as a junior DE,"Hello everyone!
I just finished my CS engineering degree and got my first job as a junior DE. The project I am working on is using Palantir foundry and I have two questions :

1. I feel like foundry is oversimplified to the point it becomes restrictive on what you can and connot do. Also, most of the time all you have to do is click on a button and it feels like monkey work to me. I have this feeling that I am not even learning the basics of DE from this job. Do we all agree that foundry is not the good way to start a DE career ?

2. For now the only thing I enjoy about my work is writing pyspark transformations. I would like to take some courses in order to have a good understanding of how spark really works. I am also planning to take a AWS certification this year. Which courses/certifications (I am working for a consulting firm) would you suggest me as a junior ?

Would appreciate any career advice from people with some experience in DE.

1qrzk69,Any major drawbacks of using self-hosted Airbyte?,"I plan on self-hosting Airbyte to run 100s of pipelines.

So far, I have installed it using abctl (kind setup) on a remote machine and have tested several connectors I need (postgres, hubspot, google sheets, s3 etc). Everything seems to be working fine.

And I love the fact that there is an API to setup sources, destinations and connections.

The only issue I see right now is it's slow. 

For instance, the HubSpot source connector we had implemented ourselves is at least 5x faster than Airbyte at sourcing. Though it matters only during the first sync - incremental syncs are quick enough.

1qrhvt7,Managing embedding migrations - dimension mapping approaches,"Data engineering question for those working with vector embeddings at scale.

The problem:

You have embeddings in production:  
• Millions of vectors from text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dim)  
• Stored in your vector DB  
• Powering search, RAG, recommendations

Then you need to:  
• Test a new embedding model with different dimensions  
• Migrate to a model with better performance  
• Compare quality across providers

Current options:

1. Re-embed everything - expensive, slow, risky
2. Parallel indexes - 2x storage, sync complexity
3. Never migrate - stuck with original choice

What I built:

An embedding portability layer with actual dimension mapping algorithms:  
• PCA - principal component analysis for reduction  
• SVD - singular value decomposition for optimal mapping  
• Linear projection - for learned transformations  
• Padding/expansion - for dimension increase

Validation metrics:  
• Information preservation calculation (variance retained)  
• Similarity ranking preservation checks  
• Compression ratio tracking

Data engineering considerations:  
• Batch processing support  
• Quality scoring before committing to migration  
• Rollback capability via checkpoint system

Questions:

1. How do you handle embedding model upgrades currently?
2. What's your re-embedding strategy? Full rebuild vs incremental?
3. Would dimension mapping with quality guarantees be useful?

1qr4dfn,Fit check for my IoT data ingestion plan,"Hi everyone! Long-time listener, first-time caller. I have an opportunity to offer some design options to a firm for ingesting data from an IoT device network. The devices (which are owned by the firm's customers) produce a relatively modest number of records: Let's say a few hundred devices producing a few thousand records each every day. The firm wants 1) the raw data accessible to their customers, 2) an analytics layer, and 3) a dashboard where customers can view some basic analytics about their devices and the records. The data does not need to be real-time, probably we could get away with refreshing it once a day.

My first thought (partly because I'm familiar with it) is to ingest the records into a BigQuery table as a data lake. From there, I can run some basic joins and whatnot to verify, sort, and present the data for analysis, or even do more intensive modeling or whatever they decide they need later. Then, I can connect the BigQuery analytics tables to Looker Studio for a basic dashboard that can be shared easily. Customers can also query/download their data directly.

That's the basics. But I'm also thinking I might need some kind of queue in front of BigQuery (Pub/Sub?) to ensure nothing gets dropped. Does that make sense, or do I not have to worry about it with BigQuery? Lastly, just kind of conceptually, I'm wondering how IoT typically works with POSTing data to cloud storage. Do you create a GCP service account for each device? Is there an API key on each physical device that it uses to make the requests? What's best practice?

1qqyv6f,How do you keep your sanity when building pipelines with incremental strategy + timezones?,"I keep running into the same conflict between my incremental strategy logic and the pipeline schedule, and then on top off that timezone make it worse. Here's an example from one of our pipelines:

\- a job runs hourly in UTC

\- logic is ""process the next full day of data"" (because predictions are for the next 24 hours)

\- the run at 03:10 UTC means different day boundaries for clients in different timezones

Delayed ML inference events complicate cutoffs, and daily backfills overlap with hourly runs. Also for our specific use case, ML inference is based on client timezones, so inference usually runs between 06:00 and 09:00 local time, but each energy market has regulatory windows that change when they need data by and it is best for us to run the inference closest to the deadline so that the lag is minimized.

Interested in hearing about other data engineers' battle wounds when working with incremental/schedule/timezone conflicts.",1769758044.0,8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qqyv6f/how_do_you_keep_your_sanity_when_building/
1qqy67i,We unified 5 query engines under one catalog and holy shit it actually worked,"So we had Spark, Trino, Flink, Presto, and Hive all hitting different catalogs and it was a complete shitshow. Schema changes needed updates in 5 different places. Credential rotation was a nightmare. Onboarding new devs took forever because they had to learn each engine's catalog quirks.

Tried a few options. Unity Catalog would lock us into Databricks. Building our own would take 6+ months. Ended up going with Apache Gravitino since it just became an Apache TLP and the architecture made sense - basically all the engines talk to Gravitino which federates everything underneath.

Migration took about 6 weeks. Started with Spark since that was safest, then rolled out to the others. Pretty smooth honestly.

The results have been kind of crazy. New datasets now take 30 mins to add instead of 4~6 hours. Schema changes went from 2~3 hours down to 15 mins. Catalog config incidents dropped from 3~4 per month to maybe 1 per quarter. Dev onboarding for the catalog stuff went from a week to 1~2 days.

Unexpected win: Gravitino treats Kafka topics as metadata objects so our Flink jobs can discover schemas through the same API they use for tables. That was huge for our streaming pipelines. Also made our multi-cloud setup way easier since we have data in both AWS and GCP.

Not gonna sugarcoat the downsides though. You gotta self-host another service (or pay for managed). The UI is pretty basic so we mostly use the API. Community is smaller than Databricks/Snowflake. Lineage tracking isn't as good as commercial tools yet.

But if you're running multiple engines and catalog sprawl is killing you, it's worth looking at. We went from spending hours on catalog config to basically forgetting it exists. If you're all-in on one vendor it's probably overkill.

Anyone else dealing with this? How are you managing catalogs across multiple engines?

1qqvw49,Data Engineer with Analytics Background (International Student) – What Should I Focus on in 2026?,"Hi everyone,  
I recently graduated with a Master’s in Data Analytics in the US, and I’m trying to transition into a Data Engineering role. My bachelor’s was in Mechanical Engineering, so I don’t have a pure CS background.

Right now, I’m on OPT (STEM OPT coming later), and I’m honestly feeling a bit overwhelmed about how competitive the market is. I know basic Python and SQL, and I’m currently learning:

* AWS (S3, Glue, Lambda, Athena)
* Data modeling (fact/dimension tables)
* dbt and Airflow
* Some PySpark 

My goal is to land an entry-level or junior Data Engineer role in the next few months.  
I’d really appreciate advice on:

1. What skills are actually critical for junior Data Engineers in 2026?
2. What projects would make my cv stand out?
3. Should I focus more on Spark/Databricks, AWS pipelines, or software engineering fundamentals (DSA, system design)?
4. Any tips for international students on finding sponsors or W-2 roles?

Be brutally honest; even if the path is hard, I want realistic guidance on what to prioritize.",1769748385.0,24,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qqvw49/data_engineer_with_analytics_background/
1qqvfu4,New Graduate Imposter Syndrome,"I'm a new grad in CS and I feel like I know nothing about this Data Engineering role I applied for at this startup, but somehow I'm in the penultimate round. I got through the recruiter call and the Hackerranks which were super easy (just some Python & SQL intermediates and an advanced problem solving). Now, I'm onto the live coding round, but I feel so worried and scared that I know nothing. Don't get me wrong, my Python & SQL fundamentals are pretty solid; however, the theory really scares me. Everything I know is through practical experience through my personal projects and although I got good grades, I never really learned the material or let it soak in because I never used it (the normalization, partitions, etc.) because my projects never practically needed it. 

  
Now, I""m on the live coding round (Python + SQL) and I don't know anything about what's going to be tested since this will be my first live coding round ever (all my internships prior, I've never had to do one of these). I've been preparing like a crazy person every day, but I don't even know if I'm preparing correctly. All I'm doing is giving AI the job description and it's asking me questions which I then solve by timing myself (which to be fair, I've solved all of them only looking something up once). I'm also using SQLZoo, LC SQL questions (which I seem to be able to solve mediums fine), and I think I've completed all of Hackerranks SQL by now lol... My basic data structure (e.g., lists, hashmaps, etc.) knowledge is solid and so are the main stdlib of python (e.g., collections, json, csv, etc.). 

The worst part is, the main technology they use (Snowflake/Snowpark), I've never even touched with a 10ft pole. The recruiter mentioned that all they're looking for is a core focus on Python & SQL which I definitely have, but I mean this is a startup we're talking about, they don't have time to teach me everything. I'm a fast learner and am truly confident in being able to pick up anything quickly, I pride myself in being adaptable if nothing else, but it's not like they would care? Maybe I'm just scared shitless and just worried about nothing. 

Has anyone else felt like this? Like I really want this position to workout and land the job, because I think I'll really like it. Any advice at all? ",1769747058.0,0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qqvfu4/new_graduate_imposter_syndrome/

1qqoayv,Degree Apprenticeships (UK) - student and employer perspectives?,"I’m looking for views on degree apprenticeships, particularly from people who’ve done one or who’ve been involved in hiring. This is mainly a UK thing, so feel free to skip if you’re unfamiliar.

**Background:**  
I’m 13 years into my data career. I started as a data analyst, moved into a BI developer role, and last week stepped into a data engineering position (though I plan to keep some analytics work alongside it).

I’ve spent my entire career at the same UK public sector organisation. It’s a very stable environment, but I don’t have a degree (just a secondary school education) and I’m starting to feel that gap more keenly. I’d like to strengthen my long-term position, fill in some theory gaps, and - now that I have a young family - set a good example by continuing my education.



So, I currently have two realistic options to consider:

**Option 1 - traditional part-time distance-learning degree (Open University):**  
One of the following...

* BSc (Hons) Computing & IT
* BSc (Hons) Computing & IT and Mathematics
* BSc (Hons) Computing & IT and Statistics

These would be around 15 hours per week and take six years to complete.

**Option 2 - degree apprenticeship (Open University, but employer/levy-funded)**

* BSc (Hons) Digital and Technology Solutions

  
This would take three years, with 20% of my paid working time allocated to study. The remaining credits come from work-based projects.

  
The apprenticeship route is obviously much faster and more manageable time-wise, but I assume the breadth and depth won’t get close to a traditional degree, especially in maths/stats. On the other hand, six years is a very long time to commit to alongside work and family.

So my questions are...

* Has anyone here done a degree apprenticeship - especially well into their career - and how did you find it?
* From an employer’s perspective, how are degree apprenticeships viewed aside regular degrees?
* Is the title '*Digital and Technology Solutions'* likely to be taken seriously, or could it be off-putting?

I'm currently working in a role similar to a product manager, but leaning more toward the engineering side. While I currently earn an ok wage (working in the EU and coming from a third world country), I feel like I don’t really see myself working in this line of work forever, and I don’t see strong career/wage progression here.

While looking for a possible career shift that could play to my strengths, I stumbled upon analytics engineering/data engineering. A lot of articles and people I’ve read on gave me the impression that it might be possible to break into the field without having a degree specifically in the area (I have a degree in materials science and if my impression of this is wrong then sorry). Btw I basically dont have any programming or analytics background except the limited amount of time I had with Matlab.

My question is:

1. Do you think this will still be true in the coming years? Considering that I’m currently working full time and can only learn in my spare time after work, I don’t plan to break into DE immediately, as I know that’s basically impossible. But maybe breaking into data analytics or analytics engineering could be more realistic and doable?
2. I'm currently starting with SQL and then plan on moving to Python, Git, some visualization tools and then dbt and cloud warehouses. Is this a solid plan or are there any other stuffs I should take into account? Any tips on typical mistakes that one can do early in these phase that might hinder/slow down my progress?
3. What are your best resources for learning and for having a decent roadmap or plan to become a data analyst, analytics engineer, or data engineer? I don’t mind paying for a course if it’s worth it. So far I'm using SQLBolt, w3schools, thoughtspot for their free courses as a start. Are there websites where I can practice writing SQL queries a lot? Any youtubers who make quality videos?

There is also the worry of AI coming in and disrupting the future job market but that is a topic that probably is gonna derail my questions here so lets skip that for now.

To automate this, I exported a job in XML format and then fed it to the copilot to generate in the ST mapping template ( copilot generated .py file) . it does to some extent but not completely and misses out some important details. 

has anyone worked on similiar activity or have some more robust solution around it , please suggest.

I also tried to export ATL files , but XML was easier to parse with python.

got a question for people who had 'pleasure' to work with Good Data. How can I increase the cache so Good Data are not constantly querying dbx? 

The design looks like this:  
databricks is scheduled to run on 3 AM so between 3:01 and 2:59 next day nothing will change in these tables  
Good Data is using these tables to show data but even though it's not direct query its constantly querying dbx after filter change or whatever because it hasn't got enough space to store the refreshed data  
  
I was Power BI developer and tbh it's hard for me to understand this problem with Good Data...  Im not the good data admin so I'm relying on devs team that 'it is what it is' and it's pissing me off because it's ridiculous.

But my main-main problem is that it's laggy even though we (5 people) are the only data consumers. It will be laggy af when clients will start using it and going above Medium warehouse on dbx will be costly and this cost will be undefendable because ROI will be way too low.

I have already built the core SaaS product (standard cloud-to-cloud sync), but I recently finished building a ""Remote Agent"" capability, and I want to sanity check with this community if this is actually a useful feature or if I'm over-engineering.

The Architecture: I’ve decoupled the Control Plane from the Data Plane.

* Control Plane (SaaS): Hosted by me. Handles the UI, scheduling, configuration, and state management.
* Data Plane (Your Infrastructure): You run a lightweight binary, or a container image, behind your firewall. It polls the Control Plane for jobs, connects to your local database (e.g., internal Postgres), and moves data directly to your destination.

I have worked at a number of big companies where a SaaS based data platform would never pass security requirements.

For those of you in regulated industries or with strict SecOps teams: Does this ""Hybrid"" model actually solve a problem for you? Or do you prefer to just go 100% SaaS and deal with security exceptions? Or do you prefer 100% Self-Hosted and deal with the maintenance headache?

1qprrd8,Is a ~12% pay cut worth it to pivot from Consulting to Analytics Engineering (Databricks) at a stable End Client?,"Hi everyone,

I am facing a career dilemma and would love some insights, especially from those who have transitioned from Consulting to an Internal Role (End Client).

My Profile:

•	Current Role: Data Analyst / BI Consultant.

•	Experience: 5 years (mainly Power BI, SQL, some Python).

•	Current Situation: Working for a Consulting Firm (ESN) in a major French city. My mission ended in December due to budget cuts, and I am currently “on the bench” (inter-contract) with my probation period ending soon.

•	The Issue: I am tired of the consulting model (instability, lack of ownership, dependency on random missions). I want to stabilize and, most importantly, transition into Analytics Engineering / Data Engineering.

The Offer (Internal Role):

I have an offer for a permanent contract (CDI) at an End Client (a digital subsidiary of a massive Fortune 500 industrial group, approx. 50 people in this specific entity).

•	Title: Senior Analytics Engineer (New position creation).

•	Tech Stack: Databricks / Spark + Power BI (Medallion architecture, Digital Performance & E-commerce focus). This is exactly the stack I need to master for my future career steps.

•	The “Catch”: The fixed base salary offer is 12.5% lower than my current base salary in consulting.

•	Variable: There is a 10% variable bonus (performance-based), which brings the total package closer to my current pay, but the guaranteed monthly income is definitely lower.

My Plan / Strategy:

1.	Tech: Acquire deep expertise in Databricks and Data Engineering (highly in demand).

2.	Domain: The role focuses on Digital Performance / E-commerce, which seems valuable.

My Questions for the community:

1.	Does taking a 12.5% step back on base salary seem justified to gain the Databricks expertise + the stability of an internal role?

2.	Is it risky to accept a “Senior” job title that pays below market rate for that level, or will the title itself be valuable on my CV in 2 years?

3.	Has anyone here taken a pay cut to pivot technically? What was the ROI after 2-3 years?

Thanks in advance for your advice!",1769643022.0,39,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qprrd8/is_a_12_pay_cut_worth_it_to_pivot_from_consulting/
1qpom8i,NoSQL ReBAC,"I’m dealing with a production MongoDB system and I’m still relatively new to MongoDB, but I need to use it to implement an authorization flow.

I have a legacy MongoDB system with a deeply hierarchical data model (5+ levels). The first level represents a tenant (B2B / multi-tenant setup). Under each tenant, there are multiple hierarchical resource levels (e.g., level 2, level 3, etc.), and entity-based access control (ReBAC) can be applied at any of these levels, not only at the leaf level. Granting access to a higher-level resource should implicitly allow access to all of its descendant resources.

The main challenge is that the lowest level contains millions of records that users need to access. I need to implement a permission system that includes standard roles/permissions in addition to ReBAC, where access is granted by assigning specific entity IDs to users at different hierarchy levels under a tenant.

I considered using Auth0 FGA, but integrating a third-party authorization service appears to introduce significant complexity and may negatively impact performance in my case. It would require strict synchronization and cleanup between MongoDB and the authorization store especially challenging with hierarchical data (e.g., deleting a parent entity could require removing thousands of related relationships/tuples via external APIs). Additionally, retrieving large allow-lists for filtering and search operations may be impractical or become a performance bottleneck.

Given this context, would it be reasonable to keep authorization data within MongoDB itself and build a dedicated collection that stores entity type/ID along with the allowed users or roles? If so, how would you design a custom authorization module in MongoDB that efficiently supports multi-tenancy, hierarchical access inheritance, and ReBAC at scale?",1769635747.0,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qpom8i/nosql_rebac/

While I'm more interested in the DE side of things, I'm trying to keep things realistic and also include DA tools (I'm assuming landing a DA job is much easier as a trainee). My stack of tools, for now, is Python (pandas), SQL, Excel, and Power BI. I'm still learning about all these tools, but when I'm actually working on my projects, I don't exactly know where SQL would fit in.

  
For example, I'm now working on a project that pulls data of a particular user from the Lichess API, cleans it up, transforms it into usable tables (using a OBT scheme), and then loads it into either SQLite or CSVs. From my understanding, and from my experience in a few previous, simpler projects, I could push all that data directly into either Excel or PowerBI and go from there. 

  
I know that, for starters, I could clean it up even further in pandas (for example, solve those NaNs in the accuracy columns). I also know that SQL does have its usefulness: I thought about finding winrates for different openings, isolating win and lose streaks, and that sort of stuff. But why wouldn't I do that in pandas or Python?

Even if I wanted to use SQL, how does that connect to Excel and Power BI? Do I just pull everything into SQLite, create a DB, and then create new columns and tables just with SQL? And then throw that into Excel/Power BI?

  
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I've been trying to wrap my head around it ever since I started learning this stuff. I've been practicing SQL on its own online, but I have yet to use it on a real project. Also, I know that some tools like SnowFlake use SQL, but I'm wondering how to apply it in a more ""home-made"" environment with a much simpler stack.

1qpii5e,"Anyone seeing faster AWS Glue 4.0 jobs lately? (~30% cost drop, no changes)","Hi everyone, 

I wanted to check something we’ve been seeing in my company with AWS Glue and see if anyone else has run into this.

We run several AWS Glue 4.0 batch jobs (around \~10 jobs, pretty stable workloads) that execute regularly. For most of 2025, both execution times and monthly costs were very consistent.

Then, starting around mid-November/early December 2025, we noticed a sudden and consistent drop in execution times across multiple Glue 4.0 jobs, which ended up translating into roughly \~30% lower cost compared to previous months.

What’s odd is that nothing obvious changed on our side:

* No code changes.
* Still on Glue 4.0.
* No config changes (DPUs, job params, etc.).
* Data volumes look normal and within expected ranges.
* The improvement showed up almost at the same time across multiple jobs.

Same outputs, same logic. Just faster and cheaper.

I get that Glue is fully managed/serverless, but I couldn’t find any public release notes or announcements that would clearly explain such a noticeable improvement specifically for Glue 4.0 workloads.

Has anyone else noticed Glue 4.0 jobs getting faster recently without changes? Could this be some kind of backend optimization (AMI, provisioning, IO, scheduler, etc.) rolled out by AWS? Any talks, blog posts, or changelogs that might hint at this?

Btw I'm not complaining at all , just trying to understand what happened.

CPU: 4 vCPU

RAM: 6 GB

Premium Storage: 80 GB (OS)

In total, also including phone and wifi services from the same provider, this company is paying around 35-40k yearly. To make matters worse, they have internal servers in which all of this used to be allocated at, but they've since got rid of the two IT people they had due to increase in wages for these roles (I'm guessing they got better offers elsewhere) and thus decided to move everything to an external provider, leaving the servers here basically unused. 

Can someone help me understand what is the correct approach to do here? People complain that the MES is slow, the outlook via the web host is obviously not ideal because no one can sync it to their phones. The price looks pretty high for a company of this size (doing around 4-5M in revenue).

Granyt is a self-hostable monitoring tool for Airflow. I built it after getting frustrated with every existing open source option:

* Sentry is great, but it doesn't know what a dag\_id is. Errors get grouped weirdly and the UI just wasn't designed for data pipelines.
* Grafana + Prometheus feels like it needs a PhD to set up, and there's no real Python integration for error analysis. Spent a week configuring everything, then never looked at it again.
* Airflow UI shows me what happened, not what went wrong. And the interface (at least in Airflow 2) is slow and clunky.

What Granyt does differently:

* Stack traces that show dag\_id, task\_id, and run\_id. Grouped by fingerprint so you see patterns, not noise. Built for DAGs from the ground up - not bolted on as an afterthought.
* Alerts that actually matter. Row count drops? Granyt tells you before the CEO asks on Monday. Just return metrics in XCom and Granyt picks them up automatically.
* Connect all your environments to one source of truth. Catch issues in dev before they hit your production environment.

1qp9sys,"Scattered DQ checks are dead, long live Data Contracts","santiviquez from Soda here.

In most teams I’ve worked with, data quality checks end up split across dbt tests, random SQL queries, Python scripts, and whatever assumptions live in people’s heads. When something breaks, figuring out what was supposed to be true is not that obvious.

We just released Soda Core 4.0, an open-source data contract verification engine that tries to fix that by making Data Contracts the default way to define DQ table-level expectations.

Instead of scattered checks and ad-hoc rules, you define data quality once in YAML. The CLI then validates both schema and data across warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Postgres, DuckDB, and others.

The idea is to treat data quality infrastructure as code and let a single engine handle execution. The current version ships with 50+ built-in checks.

Wanting to adopt Avro in an existing Kafka application (Java, spring cloud stream, Kafka stream and Kafka binders)

Reason to use Avro:

1) Reduced payload size and even further reduction post compression

2) schema evolution handling and strict contracts 

Currently project uses json serialisers - which are relatively large in size

Reflection seems to be choice for such case - as going schema first is not feasible (there are 40-45 topics with close to 100 consumer groups) 

Hence it should be Java class driven - where reflection is the way to go - then is uploading to registry via reflection based schema an option? - Will need more details on this from anyone who has done a mid-project avro onboarding

Same exact Dataset logic inside a while(true) polling loop works fine for the first five or six iterations and then the app just disappears. No exceptions. No Spark UI errors. No useful YARN logs. The application is just gone.

Running Spark 2.3 on YARN though I can upgrade to 2.4.1 if needed. Single executor with 10GB memory driver at 4GB which is totally fine for batch runs. Pseudo flow is SparkSession created once then inside the loop I poll config read parquet apply filters groupBy cache transform write results then clear cache. I am wondering if I am missing unpersist calls or holding Dataset references across iterations without realizing it.

I tried calling spark.catalog.clearCache on every loop and increased YARN timeouts. Memory settings seem fine for batch workloads. My suspicion is Dataset references slowly accumulating causing GC pressure then long GC pauses then executor heartbeat timeout so YARN kills it silently. The mkuthan YARN streaming article talks about configs but not Dataset API behavior inside loops.

Has anyone debugged this kind of silent death with Dataset loops. Do I need to explicitly unpersist every Dataset every iteration. Is this just a bad idea and I should switch to Spark Streaming. Or is there a way to monitor per iteration memory growth GC pauses and heartbeat issues to actually see what is killing the app. Batch resources are fine the problem only shows up with the long running loop.

* Queries are analytical + temporal (monthly snapshots, LAG, window functions)

we're targeting accuracy on LLM response, minimum hallucinations, high read concurrency for almost 1k-10k users

# Proposed approach

1. Columnar SQL DB as analytics store -> ClickHouse/DuckDB
2. OLTP remains source of truth -> Batch / CDC sync into column DB
3. Precomputed semantic tables (monthly snapshots, etc.)
4. LLM has read-only access to semantic tables only

# Questions

1. Does ClickHouse make sense here for hundreds of concurrent LLM-driven queries?
2. Any sharp edges with window-heavy analytics in ClickHouse?
3. Anyone tried LLM-first analytics and learned hard lessons?

I fear how can i catch up with this. Have close to 18 YOE in this area. Started with Informatica then AbInitio and now onto the Oracle stack. 

Learnt Big Data, but never used it. Forgot it. Trying to cope with the Gen AI stuff and see what can do here (atleast to keep pace with the developments)

1qp0f0i,The Data Engineer Role is Being Asked to Do Way Too Much,"

I've been thinking about how companies are treating data engineers like they're some kind of tech wizards who can solve any problem thrown at them.

Looking at the various definitions of what data engineers are supposedly responsible for, here's what we're expected to handle:

1. Development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data
2. Producing high-quality data and consistent information
3. Supporting downstream use cases
4. Creating core data infrastructure
5. Understanding the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, AND software engineering

That's... a lot. Especially for one position.

I think the issue is that people hear ""engineer"" and immediately assume ""Oh, they can solve that problem."" Companies have become incredibly dependent on data engineers to the point where we're expected to be experts in everything from pipeline development to security to architecture.

I see the specialization/breaking apart of the Data Engineering role as a key theme for 2026. We can't keep expecting one role to be all things to all people.

What do you all think? Are companies asking too much from DEs, or is this breadth of responsibility just part of the job now?

1qotieb,Best Practices for Historical Tables?,"I’m responsible for getting an HR database set up and ready for analytics.

I have some static data that I plan on refreshing on certain schedules for regular data, like location tables, region tables and codes, and especially employee data and applicant tracking data.

As part of the applicant tracking data, they also want real time data with the ATS’s data stream API (Real-Time Streaming Data). The ATS does not expose any historical information from the regular endpoint, historical data NEEDS to be exposed via “Data Stream” API.

Now, I guess my question is for best practice, should the data stream api be used to update the applicant data table with the candidate data, or have it kept separate and only add rows to a table dedicated for streaming? (Or both?)

So if

userID 123

Name = John

Current workflow status = Phone Screening

Current Workflow Status Date = 01/27/2026 2PMEST

application date = 01/27/2026

The data stream API sends a payload when a candidate’s status is updated. I imagine that the current workflow status and date gets updated, or, should it insert a new row onto the candidate data table to allow us to “follow” the candidate through the stages?

Test dataset is ~20GB of financial time-series data in Parquet (ZSTD compressed), 57 queries total.

---

## TL;DR

Platform | Warm Median | Cost/Query | Data Scanned
:--|:--|:--|:--
DuckDB Local (M) | 881 ms | - | -
DuckDB Local (XL) | 284 ms | - | -
DuckDB + R2 (M) | 1,099 ms | - | -
DuckDB + R2 (XL) | 496 ms | - | -
BigQuery | 2,775 ms | $0.0282 | 1,140 GB
Athena | 4,211 ms | $0.0064 | 277 GB

*M = 8 threads, 16GB RAM | XL = 32 threads, 64GB RAM*

**Key takeaways:**

1. DuckDB on local storage is 3-10x faster than cloud platforms
2. BigQuery scans 4x more data than Athena for the same queries
3. DuckDB + remote storage has significant cold start overhead (14-20 seconds)

---

## The Setup

**Hardware (DuckDB tests):**

- CPU: AMD EPYC 9224 24-Core (48 threads)
- RAM: 256GB DDR
- Disk: Samsung 870 EVO 1TB (SATA SSD)
- Network: 1 Gbps
- Location: Lauterbourg, FR

**Platforms tested:**

Platform | Configuration | Storage
:--|:--|:--
DuckDB (local) | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Local SSD
DuckDB + R2 | 1-32 threads, 2-64GB RAM | Cloudflare R2
BigQuery | On-demand serverless | Google Cloud
Athena | On-demand serverless | S3 Parquet

**DuckDB configs:**

    Minimal:  1 thread,  2GB RAM,   5GB temp (disk spill)
    Small:    4 threads, 8GB RAM,  10GB temp (disk spill)
    Medium:   8 threads, 16GB RAM, 20GB temp (disk spill)
    Large:   16 threads, 32GB RAM, 50GB temp (disk spill)
    XL:      32 threads, 64GB RAM, 100GB temp (disk spill)

**Methodology:**

- 57 queries total: 42 typical analytics (scans, aggregations, joins, windows) + 15 wide scans
- 4 runs per query: First run = cold, remaining 3 = warm
- All platforms queried identical Parquet files
- Cloud platforms: On-demand pricing, no reserved capacity

---

## Why Is DuckDB So Fast?

DuckDB's vectorized execution engine processes data in batches, making efficient use of CPU caches. Combined with local SSD storage (no network latency), it consistently delivered sub-second query times.

Even with medium config (8 threads, 16GB), DuckDB Local hit 881ms median. With XL (32 threads, 64GB), that dropped to 284ms.

For comparison:

- BigQuery: 2,775ms median (3-10x slower)
- Athena: 4,211ms median (~5-15x slower)

---

## DuckDB Scaling

Config | Threads | RAM | Wide Scan Median
:--|:--|:--|:--
Small | 4 | 8GB | 4,971 ms
Medium | 8 | 16GB | 2,588 ms
Large | 16 | 32GB | 1,446 ms
XL | 32 | 64GB | 995 ms

Doubling resources roughly halves latency. Going from 4 to 32 threads (8x) improved performance by 5x. Not perfectly linear but predictable enough for capacity planning.

---

## Why Does Athena Scan Less Data?

Both charge $5/TB scanned, but:

- BigQuery scanned 1,140 GB total
- Athena scanned 277 GB total

That's a 4x difference for the same queries.

Athena reads Parquet files directly and uses:

- **Column pruning:** Only reads columns referenced in the query
- **Predicate pushdown:** Applies WHERE filters at the storage layer
- **Row group statistics:** Uses min/max values to skip entire row groups

BigQuery reports higher bytes scanned, likely due to how external tables are processed (BigQuery rounds up to 10MB minimum per table scanned).

---

## Performance by Query Type

Category | DuckDB Local (XL) | DuckDB + R2 (XL) | BigQuery | Athena
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Table Scan | 208 ms | 407 ms | 2,759 ms | 3,062 ms
Aggregation | 382 ms | 411 ms | 2,182 ms | 2,523 ms
Window Functions | 947 ms | 12,187 ms | 3,013 ms | 5,389 ms
Joins | 361 ms | 892 ms | 2,784 ms | 3,093 ms
Wide Scans | 995 ms | 1,850 ms | 3,588 ms | 6,006 ms

Observations:

- DuckDB Local is 5-10x faster across most categories
- Window functions hurt DuckDB + R2 badly (requires multiple passes over remote data)
- Wide scans (SELECT *) are slow everywhere, but DuckDB still leads

---

## Cold Start Analysis

This is often overlooked but can dominate user experience for sporadic workloads.

Platform | Cold Start | Warm | Overhead
:--|:--|:--|:--
DuckDB Local (M) | 929 ms | 881 ms | ~5%
DuckDB Local (XL) | 307 ms | 284 ms | ~8%
DuckDB + R2 (M) | 19.5 sec | 1,099 ms | ~1,679%
DuckDB + R2 (XL) | 14.3 sec | 496 ms | ~2,778%
BigQuery | 2,834 ms | 2,769 ms | ~2%
Athena | 3,068 ms | 3,087 ms | ~0%

DuckDB + R2 cold starts range from 14-20 seconds. First query fetches Parquet metadata (file footers, schema, row group info) over the network. Subsequent queries are fast because metadata is cached.

DuckDB Local has minimal overhead (~5-8%). BigQuery and Athena also minimal (~2% and ~0%).

---

## Wide Scans Change Everything

Added 15 SELECT * queries to simulate data exports, ML feature extraction, backup pipelines.

Platform | Narrow Queries (42) | With Wide Scans (57) | Change
:--|:--|:--|:--
Athena | $0.0037/query | $0.0064/query | +73%
BigQuery | $0.0284/query | $0.0282/query | -1%

Athena's cost advantage comes from column pruning. When you SELECT *, there's nothing to prune. Costs converge toward BigQuery's level.

---

## Storage Costs (Often Overlooked)

Query costs get attention, but storage is recurring:

Provider | Storage ($/GB/mo) | Egress ($/GB)
:--|:--|:--
AWS S3 | $0.023 | $0.09
Google GCS | $0.020 | $0.12
Cloudflare R2 | $0.015 | $0.00

R2 is 35% cheaper than S3 for storage. Plus zero egress fees.

**Egress math for DuckDB + remote storage:**

1000 queries/day × 5GB each:

- S3: $0.09 × 5000 = $450/day = **$13,500/month**
- R2: **$0/month**

That's not a typo. Cloudflare doesn't charge egress on R2.

---

## When I'd Use Each

Scenario | My Pick | Why
:--|:--|:--
Sub-second latency required | DuckDB local | 5-8x faster than cloud
Large datasets, warm queries OK | DuckDB + R2 | Free egress
GCP ecosystem | BigQuery | Integration convenience
Sporadic cold queries | BigQuery | Minimal cold start penalty

---

## Data Format

- **Compression:** ZSTD
- **Partitioning:** None
- **Sort order:** (symbol, dateEpoch) for time-series tables
- **Total:** 161 Parquet files, ~20GB

Table | Files | Size
:--|:--|:--
stock_eod | 78 | 12.2 GB
financial_ratios | 47 | 3.6 GB
income_statement | 19 | 1.6 GB
balance_sheet | 15 | 1.8 GB
profile | 1 | 50 MB
sp500_constituent | 1 | <1 MB

---

## Data and Compute Locations

Platform | Data Location | Compute Location | Co-located?
:--|:--|:--|:--
BigQuery | europe-west1 (Belgium) | europe-west1 | Yes
Athena | S3 eu-west-1 (Ireland) | eu-west-1 | Yes
DuckDB + R2 | Cloudflare R2 (EU) | Lauterbourg, FR | Network hop
DuckDB Local | Local SSD | Lauterbourg, FR | Yes

BigQuery and Athena co-locate data and compute. DuckDB + R2 has a network hop explaining the cold start penalty. Local DuckDB eliminates network entirely.

---

## Limitations

- **No partitioning:** Test data wasn't partitioned. Partitioning would likely improve all platforms.
- **Single region:** European regions only. Results may vary elsewhere.
- **ZSTD compression:** Other codecs (Snappy, LZ4) may show different results.
- **No caching:** No Redis/Memcached.

---

1qoa34u,Help with time series “missing” values,"Hi all,

I’m working on time series data prep for an ML forecasting problem (sales prediction).

My issue is handling implicit zeros. I have sales data for multiple items, but records only exist for days when at least one sale happened. When there’s no record for a given day, it actually means zero sales, so for modeling I need a continuous daily time series per item with missing dates filled and the target set to 0.

Conceptually this is straightforward. The problem is scale: once you start expanding this to daily granularity across a large number of items and long time ranges, the dataset explodes and becomes very memory-heavy.

I’m currently running this locally in python, reading from a PostgreSQL database. Once I have a decent working version, it will run in a container based environment.

I generally use pandas but I assume it might be time to transition to polars or something else ? I would have to convert back to pandas for the ML training though (library constraints)

Before I brute-force this, I wanted to ask:

•	Are there established best practices for dealing with this kind of “missing means zero” scenario?

•	Do people typically materialize the full dense time series, or handle this more cleverly (sparse representations, model choice, feature engineering, etc.)?

•	Any libraries / modeling approaches that avoid having to explicitly generate all those zero rows?

1qo0c98,Importing data from s3 bucket.,"Hello everyone
I am loading a cover file from s3 into an amazon redshift table using copy. The file itself is ordered in s3. Example:
Col1 col2
A       B
1      4
A      C
F      G
R      T

However, after loading the data, the rows appear in a different order when I query the table, something like
Col1  Col2
1        4
A        C
A        B
R        T
F         G


There is not any primary key or sort key in the table or data in s3. And the  data very lage  has around 70000+ records. When I analysed, it is said due to parallel processing of redshift. Is there anything I could do to preserve the original order and import the data as it is?

Actually, the project I am working on is to mask the phi values from source table and after masking the masked file is generated in destination folder in s3.
Now, I have to test if each values in each column is masked or not. 
Ex: source file
Col1
John
Richard
Rahul
David
John

Destination file(masked)
Col1
Jsjsh
Sjjs
Rahul
David
Jsjsh

So, now  I have to import these two files source n destination  table if the values are masked or not.
Why I want in order? I am 
I am comparing the first value of col1 in source table with the first value of col1 in destination table. 
I want result, (these are the values that are not masked).

S.Col1   D.Col1
Rahul    Rahul
David    David


I could have tested this using join on s.col1=d.col2, but there could be values like
Sourcetable

Col1   
John 
David 
Leo

Destinatiotable
Col1
David
Djjd
Leo
Here, if I join I get the value that is masked, although David is masked as Djjd
S.col1   d.col1

Data engineers lose the direction and fall for vendor marketing that creates a false sense of security where ""Architects"" are minted without ever facing a real-world OOM killer. And, It’s a win for HR departments looking for lazy filters and vendors looking for locked-in advocates, but it stalls actual engineering growth.

1qnorsn,How to improve ETL pipeline,"I run the data department for a small property insurance adjusting company.

Current ETL pipeline I designed looks like this (using an Azure VM running Windows 11 that runs 24/7):

1. Run \~50 SQL scripts that drop and reinsert tables & views via Python script at \~1 AM using Windows Task Scheduler. This is an on-premise SQL Server database I created so it is free, other than the initial license fee.
2. Refresh \~10 shared Excel reports at 2 AM via Python script using Windows Task Scheduler. Excel reports have queries that utilize the SQL tables and views. Staff rely on these reports to flag items they need to review or utilize for reconciliation.
3. Refresh \~40 Power BI reports via Power BI gateway on the same VM at \~3 AM. Same as Excel. Queries connect to my SQL database. Mix of staff and client reports that are again used for flags (staff) or reimbursement/analysis (clients).
4. Manually run Python script for weekly/monthly reports once I determine the data is clean. These scripts not only refreshes all queries across a hundred Excel reports but it also logs the script actions to a text file and emails me if there is an error running the script. Again, these reports are based on the SQL tables and views in my database.

I got my company to rent a VM so all these reports could be ready when everyone logs in in the morning. Budget is only about $500/month for ETL tools and I spend about $300 on renting the VM but everything else is minimal/free like Power BI/python/sql scripts running automatically. I run the VM 24/7 because we also have clients in London & the US connecting to these SQL views as well as running AdHoc reports during the day so we don't want to rely on putting this database on a computer that is not backed up and running 24/7.

Just not sure if there is a better ETL process that would be within the $500/month budget. Everyone talks about databricks, snowflake, dbt, etc. but I have a feeling since some of our system is so archaic I am going to have to run these Python and SQL scripts long-term as most modern architecture is designed for modern problems.

Everyone wants stuff in Excel on their computer so I had a hard enough time getting people to even use Power BI. Looks like I am stuck with Excel long-term with some end-users, whether they are clients or staff relying on my reports.",1769452933.0,19,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qnorsn/how_to_improve_etl_pipeline/

1qnjx8b,Merging datasets with common keys,"Hi!

I've been tasked with merging two fairly large datasets. The issue is, that they don't have a single common key. Its auto data, specifically manufacturers and models of cars in Sweden for a marketplace.

The two datasets don't have a single common id between their datasets. But the vehicles should be present in both datasets. So things like the manufacturer will map 1:1 as its a smaller set. But the other fields like engine specifications and model namings vary. Sometimes a lot, but sometimes there are small tolerances like 0.5% on engine capacity. 

Previously they've had 'data analysts' creating mappings in a spreadsheet that then influences some typescript code to generate the links between them. Its super inefficient. I feel like there must be a better way to create a shared data model between them and merge them rather than attempting to join them. Maybe from the DS field.

To maintain correctness, semantic operator classification is handled by the model while numeric extraction remains rule-based. It sends the output json to the storage engine method which then returns the resultant rows.

1qn0e1i,"Darl: Incremental compute, scenario analysis, parallelization, static-ish typing, code replay & more","Hi everyone, I wanted to share a code execution framework/library that I recently published,  called “darl”.

**What my project does:**

Darl is a lightweight code execution framework that transparently provides incremental computations, caching, scenario/shock analysis, parallel/distributed execution and more. The code you write closely resembles standard python code with some structural conventions added to automatically unlock these abilities. There’s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.

Darl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.

**Target Audience:**

The motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.

**Comparison**

The closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn\_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the ""Alternatives"" section of the README.

**Quick Demo**

Here is a quick working snippet. This snippet on it's own doesn't describe much in terms of features (check our the README for that), it serves only to show the similarities between darl code and standard python code, however, these minor differences unlock powerful capabilities.

We want to implement version control for the codes that are being used in these jobs. Could someone here please suggest the best tool that can be leveraged here and the process of doing it.

Going forward after this we want to implement CI CD process as well.

A few people have asked me what I actually did day-to-day in a survey-heavy AE setting, so I built this project to make that work visible.

In practice, it’s been a mix of running KPI definition sessions with programme teams, writing and maintaining a data contract, then encoding those rules in dbt across staging, intermediate and marts. I’ve focused heavily on data quality: DQ flags, quarantine patterns for bad rows, repeatable tests, and monitoring tables (including late-arrival tracking).

I also wired in CI on PRs and automated docs publishing on merge, so changes are reviewable and the project stays easy to navigate.

This week I’m extending the pipeline “upstream”: pulling from Kobo servers to S3, then using SNS + SQS to trigger Snowpipe so RAW loads happen event-based.

Thanks in advance for any feedback and genuinely, thank you to everyone who’s helped me along the way so far. I’ve learned a lot from this community and really appreciate it.",1769342722.0,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qmheqn/surveyheavy_analytics_engineer_trying_to_move/
1qmgzam,Is multidimensional data query still relevant today? (and Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services),"Coming into the data engineering world fairly recently. Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) offers multidimensional data query for easier slice-and-dice analytics. To run such query, unlike SQL that most people know about, you will need to write MDX (Multidimensional Expressions).

Many popular BI platforms, such as Power BI, Azure Analysis Services, seem to be the alternatives that replace SSAS. Yet they don't support multidimensional mode. Only tabular mode is available.

Even all by Microsoft, is multidimensional data modeling getting retired? (and so with the concept of 'cube'?)",1769341322.0,7,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qmgzam/is_multidimensional_data_query_still_relevant/

1qm3nnr,Upskilling beyond SQL,"
I’ve been working with SQL Server for about 10 years, initially in more analytical roles, then over time into more ETL development and now ended up in a data engineer role but aware I need to broaden my technical skills to do a better job and open up more opportunities.

I can spare about half a day a week to focus on training, and have a limited budget. I would love some pointers about where to focus my efforts, as well as any courses or tutorials you’d recommend. 

I have a strong grounding in SQL/ database fundamentals such as advanced SQL queries, data models like data warehouse and data vault, testing & validation, error handling and alerts, logging, parameterising and performance tuning…but all within the context of SQL Server.

I’m confident with CI/CD in terms of developing SQL Projects with VS Code integrated with GitHub.

I’ve used and amended Python scripts for ingesting data from APIs and scraping from web pages but am not confident with Python generally.

Some of the things I’m aware of that I think would be useful are:
 - Python fundamentals
 - Data bricks
- Handling JSON
 - Docker
 - Azure cloud tooling (eg data factory)/ other cloud platforms
 - Orchestration and workflow tools
 - Other databases (not SQL Server)
 - Using APIs for advanced queries
 - Spark

Where should I start?

1qlxojt,"Looking for feedback after 5 years building a data stack for .NET (dataframe, columnar storage, connectors)","Most of you work with Python and SQL exclusively, but that’s okay your feedback is still important. Almost 10 years ago I started working for a .NET embedded BI reporting tool. This kind of tool typically sits after ETL process, however a lot of  businesses don’t follow that and simply want ETL with their dashboards all in one. The problem with that is there’s a huge gap in .NET for that functionality. Since that wasn’t the product direction, 5 years ago I started letting out that frustration by starting to code a framework that was extendable with connectors, sinks, and at the center of it was an in-memory analytical database.

Over the years I continued to work on it off and on, finally to the point where I am now. I have several connectors, an in-memory analytical database (DataBlock), my own columnar file format and engine that I nicknamed Velocity (VelocityDataBlock), ML (VectorBlock), and other various libraries for UI (UIBlock). The last two haven’t been publicly exposed yet. Here’s some code snippets of how the code looks.

### DataBlock

    var processed = await DataBlock.Connector.LoadCsvAsync(""raw_data.csv"")
        .Select(""id"", ""name"", ""value"", ""category"")
        .Where(""value"", 0, ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan)
        .Compute(""processed_value"", ""value * 1.1"")
        .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, ""processed_value"")
        .Head(1000);

### VelocityDataBlock

The snippet below materializes a DataBlock after Execute() is called.

    var topCategories = velocityBlock
        .Where(""Year"", 2024)
        .Pivot(""Category"", ""Region"", ""Sales"", AggregationType.Sum)
        .Sort(SortDirection.Descending, ""East_Sales"")
        .Head(5)
        .Execute();

It’s also possible to do something similar to what Polars does by using AsResult().

    var result = velocityBlock
        .Where(""OrderDate"", DateTime.Today.AddYears(-1), ComparisonOperator.GreaterThan)
        .AsResult();
    
    // Stream result rows
    long totalRevenue = 0;
    foreach (var row in result.EnumerateRows())
    {
        totalRevenue += row.GetValue<long>(""Revenue"");
    }
    
    // Materialize the result
    var data = result.ToDataBlock();

### Sinks

PDF export of a DataBlock.

    var pdfSink = new PdfSink
    {
        Title = ""Data Export Report"",
        Author = ""Datafication System"",
        Description = ""Automated data extraction from web sources"",
        RowLimit = 1000,
        LandscapeOrientation = true
    };
    
    using var pdfStream = await pdfSink.Transform(dataBlock);
    using var fileStream = File.Create(""report.pdf"");
    await pdfStream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);

Many of the connectors also have their sink output too, for example CSV.

    using Datafication.Sinks.Connectors.CsvConnector;
    var csvOutput = dataBlock.CsvStringSink();

There’s honestly too much I could write about, but before I ask the feedback questions, I’ll throw in that the VelocityDataBlock can typically achieve 60M rows/sec on my 2020 iMac. However, I’ve learned that .NET isn’t optimized the best on MacOS and if you try on Windows (which I’ve verified) you can easily get 100M rows a second. At some point I’ll put up a benchmark and the results. If you’re curious to test on your end, try the QueryPerformance sample from the Datafication.Storage.Velocity repo. Use “dotnet run -c Release sf50” for testing with 50M rows of data.

### Feedback Questions

1. In a data world predominantly using Python and tools like dbt is there a place for an SDK like this?
2. Was the syntax easy to understand based on the tools you’ve used?
3. Was there any functionality that you frequently use that wasn’t available?

If you have any other thoughts or questions, let me know.

1qlv3bm,Stakeholders Overengineering Solutions,"So translating stakeholder needs into specs into solutions is obviously a big part of the job. One specific aspect of this that I've been struggling with lately is that at least in our organization, there's a tendency for the stakeholders to try and directly give us what the solution should be, and it tends to be insanely complex. I often feel like it would be easier to just listen and understand the problem, propose a solution with a mockup or simplified prototype, and go from there.

The 'higher ups' like VPs and C-suite tend to be the ones who send us very complex requirements that look pretty AI-generated. It feels like it's mostly driven by them not wanting to spend time discussing or going back and forth with us.

1qltru0,Is there more to DE than this? Are their jobs out there for feeling like you actually matter?,"I'm pretty sure this isn't the norm, but I feel so exhausted with my job. The main problem is my team is not good and the company, while overall is very good/well regarded globally/competitive, is very pretentious. 

My job is not very challenging. In fact, it's the mundanity of it that exhausts me. Everything is the same over and over to process client data. There's almost 0 feedback/appreciation for it too, and I'm pretty sure the successor of the data basically passes off my work to others and pretends he did it. I of course could push myself more, learn new tech, and integrate it. But I just don't feel motivated. I still plan to do some online free courses about AI/ML soon.

But longterm, I'm not sure this job will sustain me. I have a noticeably worse mindsets (become a bit egotistical and negative myself, snarky, etc.). 

I'm in my early 30s, but about 10 years ago I switched from pre-medicine to tech. I was heavily invested in the the med route and had already applied to medical school. Then I spent too much time around some people I shouldn't have, and changed paths. Looking back, I probably wish I stayed in healthcare, though it has its own challenges and of course worse lifestyle usually. That said, there's no way I would want to switch back now.

All that to say, for so much of my life, I was looking at a career that directly helped people...so maybe that is part of my problem now. I could very well be in a 1/3 life crisis now, but overall okay (so dont worry :)). 

I'm debating a small to significant career change.

I think at the least, to save my sanity, I absolutely need to change jobs in the next year or two, if even that. Otherwise, I fear what my mind and personality will become. 

Things I've considered:
- online courses (for sure will do in the interim)

- a second masters (in tech related or business related field - my undergrad was economics, which I enjoyed)

- no further education (besides online stuff), but just change jobs

- stay at current job and do bare minimum BUT try to create a startup on the side (one big goal of mine is to be an entrepreneur some day).

Anyways, I digress. One reason for this post is because (1) I want to know if others feel this way in DE and (2) I am wondering if there are more rewarding industries out there. Something I've always been interested in is sustainability or in general, somehow making the world a better place. As cliche as it sounds, it'd be awesome to use my skills to improve the planet/humanity. I'm still looking at jobs and applying, but wanted to see if anyone here has recommendations. 


My fear is that whatever company I transition to will just be more of the same. I've been at a number of companies and in different job roles over the years, but there has not been a single one that I just loved (or even half loved). Everything felt like a cog in the wheel, like it doesn't help humanity, and just puts money in someone else's pocket.

Curious to hear if others feel this and if this is just the way of life. Or if there is something more out there that just needs to be found.",1769277340.0,29,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qltru0/is_there_more_to_de_than_this_are_their_jobs_out/
1qlt6fk,"Automatically deriving data model metadata from source code (no runtime data), has anyone done this?","Hi all,

I’m looking for prior art, tools, or experiences around deriving structured metadata about data models purely from source code, without access to actual input/output data.

Concretely: imagine you have source code (functions, type declarations, assertions, library calls, etc.), but you cannot execute it and don’t see real datasets. Still, you’d like to extract as much structured information as possible about the data being processed, e.g.:

•	data types (scalar, array, table, dataframe, tensor, …)

•	shapes / dimensions (where inferable)

•	constraints (ranges, required fields, checks in code)

•	formats (CSV, JSON, NetCDF, pandas, etc.)

•	input vs output roles

A rough mental model is something like the RStudio environment pane (showing object types, dimensions, ranges), but inferred statically from code only.

I’m aware this will always be partial and heuristic, the goal is best-effort structured metadata (e.g. JSON), not perfect reconstruction.

My question:

Have you seen frameworks, pipelines, or research/tools that tackle this kind of problem?

(e.g. static analysis, AST-based approaches, schema inference, type systems, code-to-metadata, etc.)

I have worked so far asking code authors to annotate their interface functions using the python typing.annotated framework, but I want to start taking as much documentation work of them as possible.

I know it’s mostly a crystal sphere task.

For deduktive reasoning, llms are also possible as parts of the pipeline.

1qllhix,Filemaker to Postgres Best Practise,"Hey hey fellow data engineers,

i just started a new job some months ago for a company which has a pretty wild 'organically grown' data landscape to put it mildly. The two main data storages are Filemaker applications built by non-IT consultants a while ago. They got their tweaks but for the most part serve the purpose. I was hired to kind of consolidate the data into future structure, to connect it and prepare the introduction of more serious data analysis aside of crappy excel exports.

As Filemaker JDBC routine and possibilities are rather limited and slow i wish to pull together both databases into respective schemes in one postgres db via python as this is my most convenient set-up. Therefore i got my own server with a bit of space. 

I've written some first scripts and tests and for the smaller one of the two databases this works pretty good and im quite satisfied with the result.

The problems start to occur with scaling as the other database is significantly larger and my (admittedly not very storage efficient) code would take way too long and consume way to much storage in the target structure, but as a one man DE team i just don't have sufficient time to plan a highly efficient, totally aligning target structure for the existing dbs.

So my question is if anybody has some best practises, ideas, experience, tips on how to tackle this problem. I am not fixed to the idea of that postgres db. The main goal would be to be able to systematically analyse that Filemaker DBs via SQL like queries (Joins, CTEs, Views, sophisticated reportings) and also to be able to connect the data of the two DBs. Right now i can satisfy basic analysis requirements via customly built python scripts which connect to both db's via JDBC but this is rather time consuming and far from the ideal state in my head. 

Thanks for your ideas!

Even when I write an api, I have to take that function in a jupyter notebook and run it there and copy paste and go back and forth etc. 

I personally dislike functions as well unless neccesary and there's reuse required. 

I am not sure what to do but seems like in real ides there's tools like debuggers and interactive window which helps with this. But just wanted to learn from others how can I write clean software style code where I can still not lose visibility of the data.

1ql3n7t,New Grad market for DE,"Hi all, I am an undergrad CS student contemplating taking a switch to data engineering by taking a data engineering internship over a general SWE internship for the junior year summer.

  
I am slightly worried that it seems like the new grad market is not so friendly for DE, as seen by the lack of ""new grad"" data engineer roles compared to Software engineer roles.

  
If anyone has recruited for new grad DE roles or knows about the market for new grads please give me some advice. I feel that coming out of college straight as a data engineer is not a path many take - I am wondering if it's because it's difficult to do so or some other reasons.

1ql0r1w,Certs or tools? What should I learn next as a mid level DE?,"I’m trying to decide what to learn next to make myself more competitive in my job search and would love some feedback. After \~5 years of professional experience, I think there are two main areas where my background is weaker than what a lot of current data engineering roles expect:

1. Cloud – I have some foundational certs in Snowflake and Azure, but no real hands on professional cloud experience. My previous roles were mostly on-prem.

2. Common industry standard tools – Things like Spark, Airflow, and dbt, which show up constantly in job descriptions.

I’m looking at a couple of learning paths that would be pretty time-intensive, so I’m trying to pick what will give me the most ROI. Right now I’m debating between:

1. Going deeper on cloud with a data engineering focused cert (leaning toward the AWS Data Engineer cert to diversify beyond Azure/Snowflake).

2. Spending time learning Spark and Airflow (or similar other tools) and building a realistic ETL pipeline I can put in a public repo—possibly even deploying it in the cloud with a real cluster as second step.

For a bit more context: I’m targeting mid level IC roles. I’m confident in my Python and SQL and feel good on data fundamentals (currently reading *Fundamentals of Data Engineering* as a refresh/gap fill). I’ve been getting some interviews, but mostly with companies that don’t yet have data engineers or don’t fully understand the role. Ideally, I’m trying to land somewhere with an established data team and the chance to learn from more senior engineers.

Which would you prioritize first? Or is there something else you’d recommend focusing on instead?",1769197296.0,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1ql0r1w/certs_or_tools_what_should_i_learn_next_as_a_mid/

Or you didn't read the job post.","I see a lot of posts on here about people applying for jobs and not getting interviews. We put up a job post this week for a senior role and there are so many issues with so many of the applications that we're only reaching out to about 2% of them for a screening. That's not because that's our top 2%, but because there's so much spam that comes in.

\- Pay attention to location. If it says it's in office or hybrid and your CV says you live in a different state and doesn't mention either there or a cover letter that says willing to relocate, you're going to get rejected.

\- If you need visa sponsorship and the role is not providing that, you get auto filtered out.

\- If your CV is more than a page and a half, it's not getting read. We don't have time to thoroughly read size 10 font with 0.25 inch margins filled with the buzzwords of every single python library you've ever imported.

  
Here's what you can do:  
\- Spell out if you are willing to relocate. If you saw the job req shared on Linkedin, reach out to the person and make sure they know you are willing to relocate

  
\- Focus your CV on results. How much faster did pipelines run? how much were errors decreased? How much money did you save? We don't care about specifc technologies, if you can do it with one tool you can learn to do it with another

MOST IMPORTANTLY:

\- Make your CV shorter. The #1 issue with hiring DEs is that they cannot communicate clearly and effectively to non technical stakeholders. If your CV is 4 pages of technical terms, you're throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.

\- Hiring managers want to see that you can communicate clearly, took ownership of projects, worked across orgs and made things run faster, cheaper, or more accurate.

  
Here's an example of a value driven result:

Maybe you wrote a quick script that took you 30 minutes. You didn't think of it being a huge deal. However, the process you put in place took the month close from 4 days to 2 days for your accounting team.

Most of the applications I see only focus on the BIG stuff, which is often some infrastructure project that is ongoing, and most people could do it if they were assigned to do so. If you want to stand out, saying you worked cross department to cut the month end close time in half, that's MASSIVE value.

I've been doing some experiments on how LLMs could get more handy in the day to day of working with files (CSV, Parquet, etc). Earlier last year, I built https://datakit.page and evolved it over and over into an all in-browser experience with help of duckdb-wasm. Got loads of feedbacks and I think it turned into a good shape with being an adhoc local data studio, but I kept hearing two main things/issues:

1. Why can't the AI also change cells in the file we give to it?
2. Why can't we modify this grid ourselves?

So besides the whole READ and text-to-SQL flows, what seemed to be really missing was giving the user a nice and easy way to ask AI to change the file without much hassle which seems to be a pretty good use case for LLMs.

DataKit fundamentally wasn't supposed to solve that and I want to keep its positioning as it is. So here we go. I want to see how https://opensheet.app can solve this.

Shooting for 4TB of usable storage, given rough estimate of 3GB a day for like... 20 Tickers and then some other random stuff? (Retention set at monthly, 30 days x 20 Tickers x 3GB/day = 1.8 TB. 20% empty to keep the hard drive gods happy = \~2.2TB, + other random buffer = 3TB. 4 TB should be plenty. For now?

I've got a bunch of hardware, just wanted to bounce the config off of this group to see what y'all think.

The relevant static portion of the hardware I have stands as:

* 5950x (16c/32t) - 128GB DDR4 - 2TB NVMe Boot Drive - 8 SATA ports - AMD 7900x GPU
* 5950x (16c/32t) - 64GB DDR4 - 2TB NVMe Boot Drive - 8 SATA ports
* 4x EliteDesk MiniPC - ONE of those handy NVME > 6x SATA cards that works, OKish
* 4x RPi

I've also got the below which can be configured to the above as I see fit.

* 4x 6TB HDD
* 4x 4TB HDD
* 8x 2TB HDD

This is where I could use some help, I've got a few thoughts on how to set it up.... but any advice here is welcome. Using proxmox / VMs to differentiate ""machines""

*Option 1 - Single Machine DB / 3 Node Deployment*

*Will allow me to ringfence the database compute needed to a single machine - but leave single point of failure.*

Machine 1: 5950x (16c/32t) - 128GB DDR4 - 2TB NVMe Boot Drive - 8 SATA ports

Disk Setup:

* 2x 2TB HDD (Raid0) - 4TB Storage Pool
* 2x 2TB HDD (Raid0) - 4TB Storage Pool
* 2x 2TB HDD (Raid0) - 4TB Storage Pool
* 2x 6TB HDD (Raid0) - 12TB Storage Pool

Node Setup:

* Node 1 - 5 Core / 10 Thread - 32GB Memory - 4TB Storage Pool
* Node 2 - 5 Core / 10 Thread - 32GB Memory - 4TB Storage Pool
* Node 3 - 5 Core / 10 Thread - 32GB Memory - 4TB Storage Pool

Snapshots run daily off market hours to the 12TB Drive.

*Option 2 - Multiple Machine / 6 Node Deployment*

*Will allow me to survive failure of a machine, but will need to share compute. I'll be eating drive space with this as well which I'm ok with... sorta.*

My organisation is preparing a shift from Synapse ADF pipelines to Databricks and I have some specific questions on how I can facilitate this transition.

Current General Design in Synapse ADF is pretty basic. Persist MetaData in one of the Azure SQL Databases and use Lookup+Foreach to iterate through a control table and pass metadata to child notebooks/activities etc.

Now here are some questions 

1) Does Databricks support this design right out of the box or do I have to write everything in Notebooks (ForEach iterator and basic functions) ?

2) What are the best practices from Databricks platform perspective where I can achieve similar arch without complete redesign ?

3) If a complete redesign is warranted, what’s the best way to achieve this in Databricks from efficiency and a cost perspective.

I understand the questions are too vague and it may appear as a half hearted attempt but I was just told about this shift 6 hours back and would honestly trust the veterans in the field rather than some LLM verbiage.

2. I might need to add new metrics to the user-day summary down the line, and I want it to be easy to: a) add these metrics and apply them historically and b) apply them to dependencies along the DAG also historically (like the user\_metrics table). How would this be possible efficiently?

1qjbawr,Fivetran pricing spike,"Hi DEs,

And the people using Fivetran..

We are experiencing a huge spike (more than double) in monthly costs following the March 2025 changes, and now with the January 2026 pricing updates.

Previously, Fivetran calculated the cost per million Monthly Active Rows (MAR) at the account level. Now, it has shifted to the connector (or connection) level. This means costs increase significantly — often exponentially — for any connector handling no more than one million MAR per month. If a customer has multiple connectors below that threshold, the overall pricing shoots up dramatically.

What is Fivetran trying to achieve with this change?
Fivetran's official explanation (from their 2025 Pricing FAQ and documentation) is that moving tiered discounts (lower per-MAR rates for higher volumes) from account-wide to per-connector aligns pricing more closely with their actual infrastructure and operational costs. Low-volume connectors still require setup, ongoing maintenance, monitoring, support, and compute resources — the old model let them ""benefit"" from bulk discounts driven by larger connectors, effectively subsidizing them.

Will Fivetran survive this one? My customer is already thinking about alternatives.. what is your opinion?",1769031884.0,104,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qjbawr/fivetran_pricing_spike/

1qj7daf,I am so bad at off the cuff questions about process,"1 year on from a disastrous tech assessment ended up landing me the job, a recruiter reached out and offered me a chat for what is basically my dream roll. AWS Data Engineer to develop an ingestion and analytics pipelines from IoT devices. 

Pretty much owning the provisioning and pipeline process from the ground up supporting a team of data scientists and analysts. 

Every other chat I've been to in my past 3 jobs has been me battling with imposter syndrome. But today, I got this, I know this shiz. I've been shoehorning AWS into my workflow wherever I can, I built a simulated corporate VPC and production ML workloads, learned the CDK syntax, built an S3 lake house.

But I go to the chat and its really light on actual AWS stuff. They are more interested in my thought process and problem solving. Very refreshing, enjoyable even. 

So why am I falling over on the world's simplest pipelines. 10 million customer dataset, approx 10k product catalogue, product data in one table, transaction data captured from a streaming source daily. 

One of the bullet points is ""The marketing team are interested in tracking the number of times an item is bought for the first time each day"" explain how you would build this pipeline.

Already covered flattening the nested JSON data into a columner silver layer. I read how many times an item is bought the first time each day as ""how do you track first occurance of an item bought that day""

The other person in the chat had to correct my thinking and say no, what they mean is how do you track when the customer first purchased an item overall. 

But then Im reeling from the screw up. I talk about creating a staging table with the 1st occurance each day and then adding the output of this to a final table in the gold layer. She says so where would the intermediate table live, I say it wouldn't be a real table its an in memory transformation step (meaning Id use filter pushdown and schema inference of the parquet in silver to pull the distinct customerid, productid, min(timestamp) and merge into gold where customerid productid doesn't exist. 

she said that would be unworkable with data of this size to have an in memory table, and rather than explain I didnt mean that I would dump 100 million rows into EC2 RAM, I kind of just said ah yeah, it makes sense to realise this in its own bucket. 

But im already in a twist by this point. 

Then on the drive home I'm thinking that was so dumb, if I had read the question properly its so obvious that I should have just explained that I'd create a look up table 

with the pertinent columns, customerid, productid, firstpurchase date. 

the pipeline is new data, first purchase per customer of that days data, merge into where not exists (maybe a overwrite if new firstpurchasedate < current firstpurchasedate to handle late arrival). 

So this is eating away at me and I think screw it, im just going to email the other chat person and explain what I meant or how I would actually approach it. So i did. it was a long boring email (similar to this post). But rather than make me feel better about the screw up Im now just in full cringe mode about emailing the chatter. its not the done thing. 

Recruiter didn't even call for a debrief.

- search over given block number range for events
- search a single transaction and fetch details of it do same for a block too

1qig8ea,Senior DE on on-prem + SQL only — how bad is that?,"Hey all,

I’m a senior data engineer but at my company we don’t use cloud stuff or Python, basically everything is on-prem and SQL heavy. I do loads of APIs, file stuff, DB work, bulk inserts, merges, stored procedures, orchestration with drivers etc. So I’m not new to data engineering by any means, but whenever I look at other jobs they all want Python, AWS/GCP, Kafka, Airflow, and I start feeling like I’m way behind.

Am I actually behind? Do I need to learn all this stuff before I can get a job that’s “equivalent”? Or does having solid experience with ETL, pipelines, orchestration, DBs etc still count for a lot? Feels like I’ve been doing the same kind of work but on the “wrong” tech stack and now I’m worried.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s made the jump or recruiters, like how much not having cloud/Python really matters.",1768949227.0,64,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qig8ea/senior_de_on_onprem_sql_only_how_bad_is_that/
1qifo47,How do teams handle environments and schema changes across multiple data teams?,"I work at a company with a fairly mature data stack, but we still struggle with environment management and upstream dependency changes.

Our data engineering team builds foundational warehouse tables from upstream business systems using a standard dev/test/prod setup. That part works as expected: they iterate in dev, validate in test with stakeholders, and deploy to prod.

My team sits downstream as analytics engineers. We build data marts and models for reporting, and we also have our own dev/test/prod environments. The problem is that our environments point directly at the upstream teams’ dev/test/prod assets. In practice, this means our dev and test environments are very unstable because upstream dev/test is constantly changing. That is expected behavior, but it makes downstream development painful.

As a result:

* We rarely see “reality” until we deploy to prod.
* People often develop against prod data just to get stability (which goes against CI/CD)
* Dev ends up running on full datasets, which is slow and expensive.
* Issues only fully surface in prod.

I’m considering proposing the following:

* **Dev:** Use a small, representative slice of upstream data (e.g., ≤10k rows per table) that we own as stable dev views/tables.
* **Test:** A direct copy of prod to validate that everything truly works, including edge cases.
* **Prod:** Point to upstream prod as usual.

Does this approach make sense? How do teams typically handle downstream dev/test when upstream data is constantly changing?

Related question: schema changes. Upstream tables aren’t versioned, and schema changes aren’t always communicated. When that happens, our pipelines either silently miss new fields or break outright. Is this common? What’s considered best practice for handling schema evolution and communication between upstream and downstream data teams?",1768947930.0,9,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qifo47/how_do_teams_handle_environments_and_schema/

1qidvaz,3yoe SAS-based DE experience - how to position myself for modern DE roles? (EU),"Some context:  
I have 3 years of exp, across a few projects as:  
\- Data Engineer / ETL dev  
\- Data Platform Admin

but most of my commercial work has been on SAS-based platforms. Ik this stack is often considered legacy, and honestly, the vendor locked nature of SAS is starting to frustrate me.

In parallel, I've developed ""modern"" DE skills through a CS degree and 1+ year of 1:1 mentoring under a Senior DE, combining hands-on work in Python, SQL, GCP, Airflow and Databricks/PySpark with coverage of DE theory and I also built a cloud-native end-to-end project.  
So... conceptually, I feel solid in DE fundamentals.

I've read quite a few posts on reddit, about legacy-heavy backgrounds (SAS) beign a disadvantage, which doesn't inspire optimism. I'm struggling to get interviews for DE roles - even at the Junior level, so I'm trying to understand what I'm missing.

Questions:  
\- is the DE market in EU just very tight now?  
\- How is SAS exp actually perceived for modern DE roles?  
\- How would you position this background on a CV/interviews?  
\- Which stack should I realistically double down on for the EU market - should I go allin on one setup (eg. GCP + Databricks), or keep a broader skill set across multiple tools, and are certifications worth it at this stage?

I am not happy with how much I am being paid and have been on the look out for something else for quite some time now. However, it seems there are barely any postings on the job boards I am looking at. I live in the US and I currently work remotely. I look for jobs in my city as well as remote opportunities.

I have a few questions.

1. How badly am I being underpaid?

2. How much can I reasonably expect to be paid if I were to move to a different position?

3. What should I seek out opportunity wise? Is it worth staying in DE? Should I continue to also search for SWE positions? Is there any other option that's substantially better than what I am doing right now?

1qhyv0a,Load data from S3 to Postgres,"Hello,

Goal:  
I need to reliably and quickly load files from S3 to a Postgres RDS instance.

Background:  
1. I have an ETL pipeline where data is produced to sent to S3 landing directory and stored under customer\_id directories with a timestamp prefix.  
2. A Glue job (yes I know you hate it) is scheduled every hour, discovers the timestamp directories, writes them to a manifest and fans out transform workers per directory (customer\_id/system/11-11-2011-08-19-19/ for example). transform workers make the transformation and upload to s3://staging/customer\_id/...  
3. Another Glue job scans this directory every 15 minutes, picks up staged transformations and writes them to the database   
  


Details:  
1. The files are currently with Parquet format.  
2. Size varies. ranges from 1KB to 10-15MB where medial is around 100KB  
3. Number of files is at the range of 30-120 at most.

State:  
1. Currently doing delete-overwrite because it's fast and convenient, but I want something faster, more reliable (this is currently not in a transaction and can cause some sort of an inconsistent state) and more convenient.  
2. No need for columnar database, overall data size is around 100GB and Postgres handles it easily.



I am currently considering two different approached:  
1. Spark -> staging table -> transactional swap  
Pros: the simpler of the two, not changing data format, no dependencies  
Cons: Lower throughput than the other solution.

2. CSV to S3 --> aws\_s3.table\_import\_from\_s3  
Pros: Faster and safer.  
Cons: Requires switching from Parquet to CSV at least in the transformation phase (and even then I will have a mix of Parquet and CSV, which is not the end of the world, but still), requires IAM access (barely worth mentioning).

1qh9d0d,Designing a data lake,"Hi everyone,

I’m a junior ML engineer, I have 2 years experience so I’m not THAT experienced and especially not in this.

I’ve been asked in my current job to design some sort of data lake to make the data independent from our main system and to be able to use this data for future projects such as ML and whatnot. 

To give a little context, we already have a whole IT department working with the “main” company architecture. We have a very centralized system with one guy supervising every in and out, he’s the one who designed it and he gives little to no access to other teams like mine in R&D. It’s a mix of AWS and on-prem.

Everytime we need to access data, we either have to export them manually via the software (like a client would do) or if we are lucky and there is already an API that is setup we get to use it too. 

So my manager gave me the task to try to create a data lake (or whatever the correct term might be for this) to make a copy of the data that already exists in prod and also start to pump data from the sources used by the other software. And by doing so, we’ll have the same data but we’ll have it independently whenever we want.

The thing is I know that this is not a simple task and other than the courses I took on DBs at school, I never designed or even thought about anything like this. I don’t know what would be the best strategy, the technologies to use, how to do effective logs….

The data is basically a fleet management, there are equipment data with gps positions and equipment details,  there are also events like if equipment are grouped together then they form a “job” with ids, start date, location… so it’s a very structured data so I believe a simple sql db would suffice but I’m not sure if it’s scalable.

I would appreciate it if I could get some kind of books to read or leads that I should follow to at least build something that might not break after two days.",1768841183.0,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qh9d0d/designing_a_data_lake/

Currently we only have a data lake on s3 and transform data with spark on emr. Now we are reaching limits of this architecture and we want to build a data lakehouse. We are thinking about these 2 options:

- Option 1: Databricks 
- Option 2: connect AWS tools like S3, EMR, Glue, Athena, Lake Formation, Data Zone, Sage Maker, Redshift, airflow, quick sight,...

What we want to do:
- Orchestration
- Connect to multiple different data sources, mainly APIs
- Cataloging with good exploration 
- governance incl fine grained access control and approval flows
- Reporting
- self service reporting
- Ad hoc SQL queries 
- self service SQL
- Posgres for Website (or any other OLTP DB)
- ML
- Gen Ai (eg RAG, talk to data use cases)
- share data externally

1qh4esu,Cloudflare Pipelines + Iceberg on R2 + Example Open Source Project,"Afternoon folks, long time lurker, first time poster.    I have spent some time recently getting up to speed with different ways to work with data in/out of Apache Iceberg and exploring different analytics tools / visualisation options.  I use Cloudflare a lot for my side projects, and have recently seen the 'Beta' data platform products incl. the idea of https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/data-catalog/.    
  
So, I decided to give it a go and see if I can build a real end to end data pipeline (the example is product analytics in this case but you could use it for other purposes of course).  I hope the link to my own project is OK, but it's MIT / open source: https://github.com/cliftonc/icelight.

My reflections / how it works:

\- Its definitely a beta, as I had to re-create the pipelines once or twice to get it all to actually sync through to R2 ... but it really works!  
\- There is a bit of work to get it all wired up, hence why I created the above project to try and automate it.  
\- You can run analytics tools (in this example DuckDB - https://duckdb.org/) in containers now and use these to analyse data on R2.  
\- Workers are what you use to bind it all together, and they work great.  
\- I think (given zero egress fees in R2) you could run this at very low cost overall (perhaps even inside the free tier if you don't have a lot of data or workload).   No infrastructure at all to manage, just 2 workers and a container (if you want DuckDB).  
\- I ran into quite a few issues with DuckDB as I didn't fully appreciate that its single process constraints - I had always assumed it was actually a real server - but actually it seems to now work very well with a bit of tweaking, and the fact it is near Postgres capable but running on parquet files on R2 is nothing short of amazing.  
\- I have it flushing every minute at the moment to R2, not sure what this means longer term but will send a lot more data at it over coming weeks and see how it goes. 

Happy to talk more about it if anyone is interested in this, esp. given Cloudflare is very early into the data engineering world. I am in no way affiliated with Cloudflare, though if anyone from Cloudflare is listening I would be more than happy to chat about my experiences :D

I am currently trying Strategy One to build a Semantic Layer, I got the 30 days free trial and I was testing the tool.

I am facing a very weird situation with connecting to DBeaver and Query my data.  
I have generated some random data with 1,000 Customers and 3,000 Bills (Telecom Data),  
Not all the Customers have bills (only 948 have bills)

I have created 2 models, 1st one using some of the data on a SQL Server Database and the rest using CSV, and the 2nd model only the data from SQL Server.

# 1st model (SQL + CSV):

  
\- total records = 3,000  
\- count(distinct customer\_id) returns 1,000 HOWEVER when you check the data manually there is no 1,000 distinct customer\_id  
\- select distinct customer\_id will return 1,000 IDs (which is not the case as there is only 948 distinct ID)

# 2nd model (SQL only):

\- total records = 3,052  
\- count(distinct bill\_id) returns 3,000  
\- count(distinct customer\_id) returns 1000  
\- count of duplicated bills return 0  
\- count of records with NULL bill\_id returns 0 HOWEVER when I checked the data manually I found 52 records with NULL bill\_id 

My main 2 Questions are:  
1- How to select the joining behavior between the tables (inner join, left join,..)

1qgyrpt,Understanding schema from DE rather than DA,"I am a DA and am fairly confident in SQL. 

I can happily write long queries with CTEs, debug models up and downstream and I am comfortable with window functions. 

I am working in DE as my work as afforded me the flexibility to learn some new skills. I am onboarding 25 tables from a system into snowflake. 

Everything is working as intended but I am confused about how to truncate and insert daily loads. 

I have a schema for the 25 tables and how they fit together but I'm unsure how to read it from an ingestion standpoint. 

It works by the main tables loading 45 past dates and 45 future dates every day. So I can remove that time chunk in the truncate task and then reinsert it with the merge task using streams for each. The other tables ""fork"" out from here with extra details to do with those events.

What I'm unsure of is how to interact with data that is removed from the system, since this doesn't show up in the streams. Ie, a staff time sheet from 2 weeks ago gets changed to +30 minutes or something. 

In the extremity tables, there is no dates held within.

If I run a merge task using the stream from that days ingestion, what do I use as the target for truncate tasks?

What is the general thought process when trying to understand how the schema fits together in regards to inserting and streaming the data rather than just making models?

1qg2fz2,dc-input: turn any dataclass schema into a robust interactive input session,"Hi all! I wanted to share a Python library I’ve been working on. Feedback is very welcome, especially on UX, edge cases or missing features.

[https://github.com/jdvanwijk/dc-input](https://github.com/jdvanwijk/dc-input)

**What my project does**

I often end up writing small scripts or internal tools that need structured user input. ​This gets tedious (and brittle) fa​st​, especially​ once you add nesting, optional sections, repetition, ​etc.

This ​library walks a​​ dataclass schema instead​ and derives an interactive input session from it (nested dataclasses, optional fields, repeatable containers, defaults, undo support, etc.).

For an interactive session example, see: [https://asciinema.org/a/767996](https://asciinema.org/a/767996)

​This has been mostly been useful for me in internal scripts and small tools where I want structured input without turning the whole thing into a CLI framework.

\------------------------

For anyone curious how this works under the hood, here's a technical overview (happy to answer questions or hear thoughts on this approach):

The pipeline I use is: schema validation -> schema normalization -> build a session graph -> walk the graph and ask user for input -> reconstruct schema. In some respects, it's actually quite similar to how a compiler works.

**Validation**

The program should crash instantly when the schema is invalid: when this happens during data input, that's poor UX (and hard to debug!) I enforce three main rules:

* Reject ambiguous types (example: str | int -> is the parser supposed to choose str or int?)
* Reject types that cause the end user to input nested parentheses: this (imo) causes a poor UX (example: list\[list\[list\[str\]\]\] would require the user to type ((str, ...), ...) )
* Reject types that cause the end user to lose their orientation within the graph (example: nested schemas as dict values)

None of the following steps should have to question the validity of schemas that get past this point.

Normalization

This step is there so that further steps don't have to do further type introspection and don't have to refer back to the original schema, as those things are often a source of bugs. Two main goals:

* Extract relevant metadata from the original schema (defaults for example)
* Abstract the field types into shapes that are relevant to the further steps in the pipeline. Take for example a ContainerShape, which I define as ""Shape representing a homogeneous container of terminal elements"". The session graph further up in the pipeline does not care if the underlying type is list\[str\], set\[str\] or tuple\[str, ...\]: all it needs to know is ""ask the user for any number of values of type T, and don't expand into a new context"".

**Build session graph**

This step builds a graph that answers some of the following questions:

* Is this field a new context or an input step?
* Is this step optional (ie, can I jump ahead in the graph)?
* Can the user loop back to a point earlier in the graph? (Example: after the last entry of list\[T\] where T is a schema)

**User session**

Here we walk the graph and collect input: this is the user-facing part. The session should be able to switch solely on the shapes and graph we defined before (mainly for bug prevention).

The input is stored in an array of UserInput objects: these are simple structs that hold the input and a pointer to the matching step on the graph. I constructed it like this, so that undoing an input is as simple as popping off the last index of that array, regardless of which context that value came from. Undo functionality was very important to me: as I make quite a lot of typos myself, I'm always annoyed when I have to redo an entire form because of a typo in a previous entry!

Input validation and parsing is done in a helper module (\_parse\_input).

**Schema reconstruction**

Take the original schema and the result of the session, and return an instance.",1768722117.0,2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qg2fz2/dcinput_turn_any_dataclass_schema_into_a_robust/
1qfznzw,Is Data Engineering the next logical step for me as an Insights Analyst,"I had a read over the excellent wiki maintained here and I'm definitely leaning towards ""yes"" as the answer to this, but wanted to hear some first-hand experience about my specific situation.

**TLDR Summary:**

* Getting burnt out/bored of data analysis after 13 years (especially stakeholder management).
* Am comfortable on my current pay grade and don't need high vertical movement.
* Want to learn new skills that will be useful going into the agentic future.
* Enjoy building data models & working with Streamlit/Python to create small applications.
* No experience in ITIL structure as I've always been in a merchandising/marketing team.

**Longer Details**

I've been working in the customer intelligence/insights field in FMCG for over 13 years now. I've been in my most recent role for 3 years and I realised at about the 2 year mark that I was about as senior as I could get in my team and was not learning anything new - simply applying my extensive experience/knowledge on the field to providing solutions/analyses for stakeholders.

That realisation combined with a live demonstration from Snowflake on the agentic future of analysis got me looking for the next logical career step. There is a data engineering secondment opportunity in my org that will likely be made permanent, so I really need to knuckle down and decide.

Over the last year, the most enjoyment that I've had has not been when providing any insights, but in building data models for reports and in creating small tools using Streamlit/Python to help stakeholders/team members self-serve and reduce friction. The tool-building component is what I found the most enjoyment in because it was all new with a steep/rapid learning curve. Creating the actual permanent BI reports is also interesting and rewarding, but less engaging because there's generally less of a problem to solve there. What does everyone find the most engaging about their role in data engineering?

I don't actually have any formal training or experience in working in an ITIL system as I've always operated under a merchandising/marketing team structure, so I'm not sure at all how I'd go with a more rigid structure and more rigid processes. Has anyone moved in a similar fashion from a more ""fast and loose"" team to a more structured/process-heavy team? What are the pros/cons there?

And finally, what does everyone find the most frustating about data engineering? From my brief exposure to the teams that handle it, I imagine that it would be stuff like; undocumented data sources and trying to find the correct joins, validation and constant data quality checks, getting clear answers from a BA on the requirements so that you can create an efficient schema/model.",1768712975.0,4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qfznzw/is_data_engineering_the_next_logical_step_for_me/

It had a lot of the cliche pitfalls but they had leadership in place and processes and roles and responsibilities squared away to a degree

1qf6xgx,I have a problem statement and I'm thinking of a design. I would like to hear other's opinions as well.,"Hi everyone, I’m stuck on a data modeling / pipeline design problem and would really appreciate guidance.

Current architecture

We have a layered warehouse with SCD-style pipelines:

Raw / Landing layer

Data arrives from multiple sources at different frequencies. All rows have some As of date value.

We snapshot it and store delta with valid\_from / valid\_to. If there is no change in the columns we are checking, the older asofdate row stays valid. 

Transformation layer

We transform raw data and store snapshots (still SCD-style).

Presentation layer

We do as-of-date reporting.

Each presentation view maps to a specific snapshot via metadata tables. 

For any requested as-of date, we pick the correct chunk using a framework we have created. What it does is it simply provides us with a timestamp that we can get records from the snapshot that were valid at that particular time. 

So far, all transformations in lower layers always run on the latest available data, and only at the final presentation layer do we resolve which snapshot chunk to use. This has worked well until now.

New problem

Now we have reporting use cases where even on the lower level, calculation won't happen on the latest data but the business will specify the dates. 

Example:

For a report as of Aug 2025:

Dataset A should use its Dec 2025 snapshot (business rule).

Dataset B should use its Aug 2025 snapshot.

I was just thinking that every time a snapshot runs, I will store the timestamp and the asofdate this snapshot date corresponds to in a metadata table and in this way, we will have a way to get a timestamp. And I will parameterise the date picking in each logic sitting in the transformation layer instead of just using valid\_to equals NULL. 

Is there anything else that I should think about ? Is there a better way to approach it ? And I will also love to have any book recommendations related to DE System Design. ",1768634928.0,1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qf6xgx/i_have_a_problem_statement_and_im_thinking_of_a/

1qf0y19,Lack of Network Connectivity in Fabric!,"I have built data engineering solutions (with spark) in HDInsight, Azure Synapse, Databricks, and Fabric.

Sometimes building a solution will go smoothly; and other times I cannot even connect to my remote resources.  In Fabric the connectivity can be very frustrating.  They have a home-grown networking technology that lets spark notebooks connect to Azure resources.  The interface is called ""Managed Private Endpoints"" (MPE).  It is quite different than connecting via normal service endpoints (within a VNET).  This home-grown technology used to be very unreliable and buggy; but about a year ago it finally became about as reliable as normal TCP/IP (albeit there is still a non-zero SLA for this technology, that you can find in their docs.)

The main complaint I have with MPE's is that Microsoft is required to make them available on a ""onesie-twosie"" basis for each and every distinct azure resource that you want to connect to!  The virtualized networking software seems like it must be written in resource-dependent way.

Microsoft had asked Synapse customers to move to Fabric a couple years ago, before introducing many of the critical MPE's.  The missing MPE's have been a show-stopper, since we had previously relied on them in Synapse.  About a month ago they FINALLY introduce a way to use an MPE to connect our spark workloads to our private REST APIs (HTTP with FQDN host names).  That is a step forward, although the timing leaves a lot to be desired.

There are other MPE's that are still not available.  Is anyone aware why network connectivity doesn't get prioritized at Microsoft?  It seems like such a critical requirement for data engineers to connect to our data!!  If I had to make guess, these delays are probably for non-technical reasons.  In this SaaS platform Microsoft is accustomed to making a large profit on their so-called ""gateways"" that move data to ADF and Dataflows (putting it into Fabric storage).  Those data-movement activities will burn thru a ton of our CU credits ... whereas making a direct connection to MPE resources is going to have a much lower cost to customers.  As always, it is frustrating to use a SaaS where the vendor puts their own interests far above those of the customer.   
  
Is there another explanation for the lack of MPE network connectivity into our azure tenant? ",1768617496.0,3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qf0y19/lack_of_network_connectivity_in_fabric/

What would be the most cost effective way to process OpenLineage events from Spark into S3, as well as custom events I produce via Python‘s OpenLineage client package?

I considered managed Flink or Kafka, but these seem like overkill. I want the events emitted from Glue ETL jobs during regular pollung operations. We only have about 500 jobs running a day, and so I’m not sure large, expensive tooling is justified.

I also considered using lambda to write these events to S3. This seems like overkill too, because it’s a whole lambda boot and process per event. Not sure if this is unsafe for some reason as well, or if it risks corruption due to (e.g.,) non-serialized event processing?

What have you done in the past? Should I just bite the bullet and introduce Flink to the ecosystem? Should I just accept Lambda as a solution? Is there something I’m missing, instead?

1qexmyu,"""semantic join"" problems","I know this subreddit kinda hates LLM solutions, but I think there is an undeniable and underappreciated fact about this. If you search on various forums like SO, reddit, community forums of various data platforms etc. for terms like (would link them, but can't here):

1. fuzzy matching
2. string distance
3. CRM contact matching
4. software list matching
5. cross-referencing \[spreadsheets\]
6. ...

and so on, you find hundreds or thousands of posts dealing with seemingly easy issues where you have the classic example of not having your join keys exactly matching, and having to do some preprocessing or softening of the keys on which to match. This problem is usually trivial for humans, but very hard to generically solve. Solutions range from stuff like fuzzy string matching, levenshtein distance, word2vec/embedding to custom ML approaches. I personally have spent hundreds of hours over the course of my career putting together horrendous regexes (with various degrees of success). I do think there is still use for these techniques in some relatively specific cases, such as when we are talking about big data and stuff, but for all those CRMs systems that need to match customers to companies that are under 100k rows of rows and so on, it's IMHO solved for negligible cost (like dollars compared to hundreds or thousands of hours of human labour). 

There are different shades of ""matching"" - I think most of the readers imagine something like a pure ""join"" with matching keys, a pretty rare case in the world of messy spreadsheets or outside of RDBMs. Then there are some trivial cases of transformation like capitalization of strings where you can pretty easily get to a canonical form and match on that. Then there are those cases that you still can get quite far with some kind of ""statistic"" distance. And finally there are scenarios where you need some kind of ""semantic distance"". The latter, IMHO the hardest, is something like matching list of S&P500 companies, where you can't really get the results correct unless you do some kind of (web)search. Example is e.g. a ticker change for Facebook in 2022 from FB to META. I believe today LLMs opened the door to solving all of those.

For example, a classic issue companies have is matching all the used software by anyone in the company to licenses or whitelisted providers. This can be now done by something like this python-pseudocode:

    software = pd.read_csv(""software.csv"", columns=[""name""])
    suppliers = set(pd.read_csv(""suppliers.csv"", columns=[""company""]))
    
    def find_sw_supplier(software_name: str, suppliers: set[str]) -> str | None:
        return call_llm_agent(
            f""Find the supplier of {software_name}, try to match it to the name of a company from the following list: {suppliers}. If you can't find a match, return None."",
            tools=[WebSearch],
        )
    
    for software_name in software[""name""]:
        supplier = find_sw_supplier(software_name, suppliers)
        df.loc[idx, ""supplier""] = supplier

It is a bit tricky to run at scale, and can get pricey, but depending on a task it can be drawn down quite significantly depending on the usecase. For example, for our usecases we were able to trim down the cost and latency in our pipelines by doing some routing (like only sending to LLMs what isn't solved by local approaches like regexes) and by batching LLMs calls together and ultimately fit it into something like (disclosure: this is our implementation):

    from everyrow.ops import merge
    
    result = await merge(
        task=""Match trial sponsors with parent companies"",
        left_table=trial_data,
        right_table=pharma_companies,
        merge_on_left=""sponsor"",
        merge_on_right=""company"",
    )

and given these cases are basically embarrassingly parallel (in the stupidest way, you throw every row on all the options), the latency mostly boils down to the available throughput and longest-llm-agent-with-search, in our case we are running virtually arbitrary (publicly web-searchable) problems under 5 minutes and 2-5$/1k of rows to merge (trivial cases are of course for 0, most of the cost is eaten by LLMs generations and web search through things like serper and stuff). 

This is of course one of the few classes of problems that are possible now and weren't before. I don't know, but I find it fascinating - in my 10-year career, I haven't experienced such a shift. And unless I am blind, it seems like this still hasn't been picked up by some of the industries (judging based on the questions from the various sales forums and stuff). Are people just building this in-house and it's just not visible, or am I overestimating how common this pain point is?",1768609762.0,19,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qexmyu/semantic_join_problems/

I currently pull reports into Excel weekly to update a few Power BI dashboards that I built. I know the basics of Python, R, and SQL, but mainly do all of my analysis in Excel.

In short, my boss would like to see a combined Power BI dashboard of our Amazon and Shopify data that updates weekly. I am researching which software would be best for automatic API pulls from Seller Central and Shopify with low code and minimal manual work. So far, I am leaning toward Airbyte because of the free trial and low cost, but I am also looking into Windsor.ai, Adzviser, and Portable.

1qelsee,How to Keep Business Users Autonomous,"I'm a data engineer in a local government organization and we're clearly stuck in a strategic impasse with our data architecture.

We're building a classic data architecture: DataLake, DataWarehouse, ETL, DataViz. On-premise only due to sovereignty requirements and no Google/Microsoft. That's fine so far. The problem is we're removing old tools like Power BI and Business Objects that allowed business teams to transform their data autonomously and in a decentralized way.

Now everything goes through the warehouse, which is good in theory. But concretely, our data team manages the ETL for generic data, the business teams will have access to the warehouse plus a dataviz tool, and that's it. There's no tool to transform business-specific data outside of Python. And that's the real problem: 90% of business analysts will never learn Python. We just killed their autonomy without replacing it with anything.

I'm looking for an open-source, on-prem or self-hosted tool that would allow non-expert business users to continue transforming their data ergonomically. The business teams are starting to panic and honestly I'm pretty lost too.

Do you have any recommendations?",1768583377.0,2,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qelsee/how_to_keep_business_users_autonomous/
1qelnbt,"Passed a DP-700, let me share my experience","Today I passed the DP-700: Implement data engineering solutions using Microsoft Fabric exam certification.

It was challenging, more complex than the DP-203 Data engineering on Azure, but still doable.

For preparation, I completed the full Microsoft learning course on the topic, but skipped most of the practice exercises.

I only explored a few to get a sense of them.

I also didn’t use the Microsoft Fabric trial offer, but I did complete one of the Applied Skills exercises, where you get hands-on practice creating databases and tables directly within the Fabric interface.

That helped a lot for understanding the environment.



My main training point was the ""Practice for the exam"" section at the course page, which gives you 50 questions per attempt.

Some questions repeated, I suggest there are about 200 in the pool. These questions are easier than the actual exam ones, but they gave me the spirit.



The actual exam structure differs noticeably from what’s described on the official page. There are 51 questions instead of 50.

41 questions are in the first section, you can review them in random order or in a batch but before you go to the next part.

And 10 more are in a case study, which is reviewed in whole separately.



What I must say: do not be afraid of KQL. I knew almost nothing of it, but basic sense and logic were quite enough.

They don't ask you very complex questions on KQL.



I faced no occurences of Synapse, but Eventhouses and Eventstreams were frequent.

Familiarize yourself with the hierarchy of Fabric levels and what belongs to each.

Domains and subdomains didn’t appear in the questions either, but organizing them mentally was worth it.

Use AI during preparation to structure your understanding of Fabric components: workspaces, eventhouses, pipelines, dataflows, databases and spark pools.



I have seen numerous pieces of advice on Aleksi Partanen Certiace, Fabricforge and similar resources, and I even looked into their videos, but did not use that much.

Yes, I know they say that the official Learn is not sufficient, but my case proves otherwise.



Use Microsoft Learn, this is allowed throughout the exam!

Moreover, for some questions it is essential to use the manuals.

There is zero value in memorizing the \`sys\_dm\_requests\_anything\` names, contents and uses.

During real work, you will definitely lookup the manpage for it. So the same applies to an exam as well.



Even better, MS Learn has an AI assistant builtin. And you actually can type exactly the question you see at the screen.

Again, this resembles the real work process so this is not just allowed, but asking AI is an important part of your expertise.

Because after that, you must extract meaningful parts from an AI response and use it accordingly.



There were a few what I’d call ""questionable"" items: overly wordy definitions leading to self-evident choices, but fewer than in the practice quizzes.



Some parts I still don’t fully grasp, such as all features for Dataflow Gen2 versus Spark in complex scenarios.

Still, this is an intermediate-level exam, so I think that's just enough knowledge for now.",1768583073.0,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qelnbt/passed_a_dp700_let_me_share_my_experience/
1qel3sz,Seeking advice,"Hello everyone, I’m a 2025 graduate in Big Data Analytics and currently looking for my first job. It’s been about 5.5 months since my internship ended, and during this time I’ve been doing a lot of reflection on my academic journey. The program was supposed to prepare us for roles like Data Analyst, Data Engineer, or Data Scientist, but honestly, I have mixed feelings about how effective it really was.

Over three years, we covered a huge range of topics: statistics, machine learning, big data, databases, networking, cybersecurity, embedded systems, image processing, mobile development, Java EE/ spring bot, SaaS development, ETL, data warehousing, Kafka, spark, and more. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, it often felt scattered and a bit inefficient.

We kept jumping between multiple languages (C, java, python, javascript) without enough time to truly master any of them. Many technical modules stayed very theoretical, with little connection to real-world use cases: real datasets, real production pipelines, proper data engineering workflows, or even how to debug a broken pipeline beyond adding print statements. Some courses were rushed, some poorly structured, and others lacked continuity or practical guidance.



I know university is meant to build foundations, not necessarily teach the latest trendy tools. Still, I feel the curriculum could have been more focused and better aligned with what data roles actually require today, such as:

* strong SQL and solid database design
* Strong python for data processing and pipelines 
* Real ETL and data modeling projects 
* Distributed systems with clear, practical applications
* A clear separation between web development tracks and data tracks
* Better guidance on choosing ML algorithms depending on the use case

Instead, everything was mixed together: web dev, mobile dev, low-level systems, data science, big data, and business, without a clear specialization path.

Now I’m trying to fill the gaps by self-studying and building real projects, mainly with a data engineering focus. For context, here are the main projects I worked on during my internships:

1. Machine test results dashboard  

* A web application to visualize machine test results.  
* Stack: Django REST Framework, MongoDB, React.

It was a 2-person project over 2 months. I was responsible for defining what should be displayed (failure rate, failure rate by machine/section, etc.) and implementing the calculation logic while making sure the results were accurate. I also helped with the frontend even though it was my first time using JavaScript. A lot of it was assisted by chatgpt and claude, then reviewed and corrected with my teammate.

2. Unix server resource monitoring system   

A server monitoring platform providing:

* Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, disk, and network via websockets  
* Historical analysis with time-series visualization
* ML-based anomaly detection using Isolation Forest
* Server management (CRUD, grouping, health tracking)
* Scalable architecture with Kafka streaming and redis caching

Stack: Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, redis, Kafka, Angular 15, all containerized with Docker.

I admit the stack is more “web-heavy” than “pure data engineering,” but it was chosen to match the company’s ecosystem and increase hiring chances (especially Angular, since most of their tech team were web developers). Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a position.

Now I’d really need advice from people already working in data engineering:

* What core skills should I prioritize first? 
* How deep should I go into SQL, Python, and system design?
* What kinds of projects best show readiness for a junior data engineer role(and where can i get the data like the millions of rows of data aside from web scraping)?
* How do you personally bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations?
*  What are your thoughts on certifications like those on Coursera?
* And for the love of god … how do you convince HR that even if you’ve never used their exact stack, you have the fundamentals and can become operational quickly?

Any advice, feedback, or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.

\---

\*\*TL;DR\*\*  

My data program covered a lot but felt too scattered and too theoretical to fully prepare for real data engineering roles. I’m now self-learning, building projects, and looking for guidance on what skills to prioritize and how to position myself as a solid junior data engineer.",1768581923.0,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qel3sz/seeking_advice/

1qejnn6,Messy Data Problems: How to get Stakeholders on Board,"Hello! This is my first post in this sub. I’ve seen a lot of strong practical advice here and would like to get multiple perspectives on how to approach a messy data cleanup and modeling problem.

Until recently, I worked mostly at startups, so I never dealt with serious legacy data issues. I just joined a midsized private company as an “Analyst.” During the hiring process, after hearing about their challenges, I told them it sounded like they really needed a data engineer or more specifically an analytics engineer. They said nope we just need an analyst, which i thought was odd. FYI: They already have an ERP system, but the data is fragmented, difficult to retrieve, and widely acknowledged across the company as dirty and hard to work with.

Once I joined, I got access to the tools I needed fairly quickly by befriending IT. However, once I started digging into the ERP backend, I found some fundamental problems. For example, there are duplicated primary keys in header tables. While this can be handled downstream, it highlights that even basic principles like first normal form were not followed. I understand ERPs are often denormalized, but this still feels extreme.

Some historical context that likely contributed to this:

* In the past, someone was directly injecting data via SQL
* The company later migrated to a cloud ERP
* Business processes have changed multiple times since then

As a result, naming conventions, supplier numbers, product numbers, and similar identifiers have all changed over time, often for the same logical entity. Sales data is especially messy. Some calculated fields do not align with what is defined in the ERP’s data dictionary, and overall there is very little shared understanding or trust in the data across the company.

Constraints I am working under:

* I have read-only access to the ERP and cannot write data back, which is appropriate since it is the raw source
* of-course the ERP is not a read-optimized database, so querying it directly is painful
* There are over 20,000 tables in total, but after filtering out audit, temp, deprecated, and empty tables, I am down to roughly 500 tables
* Total row count across those tables is likely 40 to 50 million rows, though normalization makes that hard to reason about
* I am the first and only data-focused hire

The business context also matters. There are no real long-term data goals right now. Most work is short-term:

* One-week automations of existing manual processes
* One to two month dashboard and reporting projects

Stakeholders primarily want reports, dashboards, and automated spreadsheets. There is very little demand for deeper analysis, which makes sense given how unreliable the underlying data currently is. Most teams rely heavily on Excel and tribal knowledge, and there is effectively zero SQL experience among stakeholders.

My initial instinct was to stand up a SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance and start building cleaned, documented models or data marts by domain. However, I am not convinced that:

1. I will get buy-in for that approach
2. It is the right choice given maintainability and the short-term nature of most deliverables

As a fallback, I may end up pulling subsets of tables directly into Power BI and doing partial cleaning and reshaping using Power Query transformations just to get something usable in front of stakeholders.

So my core question is:  
**How would you approach cleaning, organizing, documenting, and storing this kind of historically inconsistent ERP data while still delivering short-term reports and dashboards that stakeholders are expecting?**

If I am misunderstanding anything about ERPs, analytics engineering, or data modeling in this context, I would appreciate being corrected.",1768578820.0,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qejnn6/messy_data_problems_how_to_get_stakeholders_on/

The more fragmented your data stack is, the higher the chance of breakage.

And now if you slap AI on top of it, it makes it worse.

I've come across many broken data systems where the team wanted to add AI on top of it thinking it will fix everything, and help them with decision making. But it didn't, it just exposed the flaws of their whole data stack.

I feel that many are jumping on the AI train without even thinking about if their data stack is 'able', otherwise it's pretty much pointless.

Fragmentation often fails because semantics are duplicated and unenforced.

This leaves me thinking that the only way to fix this is to find a way to fully unify everything(to avoid fragmentation) and avoid semantic duplication with platforms like Definite or any other all-in-one data platforms that will pretty much replace all you data stack.",1768554877.0,65,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qebb1m/ai_on_top_of_a_broken_data_stack_is_useless/

1qe02ol,Pragmatism and best practice,"Disclaimer: I'm not a DE but a product manager who has been in my role managing our company's data platform for the last ten months. I come from a non-technical background and so it's been a steep learning curve for me. I've learnt a lot but I'm struggling to balance pragmatism and best practice. 

For context:

\- We are a small team on a central data platform 

\- We do not have any defined data modelling standards or governance standards that are implemented

\- The plan was to move away from our current implementation towards a data mart design. We have a DA but there's no alignment at the senior leadership level across product and architecture so their priorities are elsewhere

\- Analysts sit in another department 

The engineers on my team are understandably advocating for bringing in some foundational modelling, standards work but the company expects quick outputs. 

I want to avoid over-engineering but I'm concerned we will incur a lot of tech debt later on down the line that will need to be unpacked - that's on top of the company not getting the value it envisioned with a platform.

For anyone who has been in this situation do you have any guidance on whether you have:

\- Taken a step back to focus on foundational work? I know a full-scale enterprise data model is not happening at this point but is there something we can begin to bring into our sprints for our higher value use cases? 

\- Do you have a definition of 'good enough' to help keep you moving while minimising later pain?

1qdv3wh,Getting off of Fabric.,"Just as the title says. Fabric has been a pretty rough experience.

I am a team of one in a company that has little data problems. Like, less than 1 TB of data that will be used for processing/analytics in the future with < 200 people with maybe \~20 utilizing data from Fabric. Most data sources (like 90 %) are from on-prem SQL server. The rest is CSVs, some APIs.

A little about my skillset - I came from a software engineering background (SQLite, SQL Server, C#, WinForms/Avalonia). I’m intermediate with Python and SQL now. The problem. Fabric hasn’t been great, but I’ve learned it well enough to understand the business and their actual data needs.

The core issues:

* Random pipeline failures or hangs with very little actionable error output
* Ingestion from SQL Server relies heavily on Copy Data Activity, which is slow and compute-heavy
* ETL, refreshes, and BI all share the same capacity
* When a pipeline hangs or spikes usage, capacity shoots up and Power BI visuals become unusable
* Debugging is painful and opaque due to UI-driven workflows and preview features

The main priority right now is stable, reliable BI. I'm open to feedback on more things I need to learn. For instance, better data modeling.

Coming from SWE, I miss the control and being granular with execution and being able to reason about failures via logs and code.

I'm looking at Databricks and Snowflake as options (per the Architect that originally adopted Fabric) but I think since we are still in early phases of data, we may not need the price heavy SaaS.

I’m feeling lost about how I should go about my next step in my career, so I was hoping I could find some guidance here.

My story:

I never finished school, but continued learning programming and whatnot through good ol’ YouTube University, docs, etc - primarily focused on web dev as it was the most accessible.

During school and self teaching, I was working in the service industry (\~6 years of bartending).

Around the middle of 2024, I finally landed my first job in tech in a contracted role as a DE. The contracting company had us train for a couple of months, and then sent us to a predetermined company where I worked primarily with Snowflake and PowerBI. I worked with SQL primarily, and because of my experience with scripting languages, was easily writing SP’s in JS, Python, and even had some fun with Snowflake’s scripting language.

\*Small context of the company I was contracted to\*:

A brand new company that broke off of a very, very large company. This made working here feel somewhat like a startup, but also already had an insane net worth and company infrastructure/hierarchy. The people I get to work with here are amazing, and it’s been a really amazing experience. Unfortunately, a lot of talent is being dropped from the US and moved to India.

So, to the reason for this post:

Does anyone have any guidance for where I should go from here? I have worked for 1.5 years in this role as a DE, but every entry level job posting I see seems to be looking for 1 of or a mix of:

\- Several years experience

\- Degree

1qdp2sl,How do you test db consistency after a server migration?,"I'm at a new job and the data here is stored in 2 MSSQL tables, table\_1 is 1TB, table\_2 is 500GB. I'm tasked with ensuring the data is the same post migration as it is now. A 3rd party is responsible for the server upgrade and migration of the data. 

My first thought is to try and take some summary stats, but Select count(\*) from table\_1 takes 13 mins to execute. There are no indexes or even a primary key. I thought maybe I can hash a concatenation of the columns now and compare to the migrated version, but with the sensitivity of hash functions, a non material change would likely invalidate this approach.

1qddfz7,Handling 30M rows pandas/colab - Chunking vs Sampling vs Lossing Context?,"I’m working with a fairly large dataset (CSV) (~3 crore / 30 million rows). Due to memory and compute limits (I’m currently using Google Colab), I can’t load the entire dataset into memory at once.

What I’ve done so far:

- Randomly sampled ~1 lakh (100k) rows
- Performed EDA on the sample to understand   distributions, correlations, and basic patterns

However, I’m concerned that sampling may lose important data context, especially:

- Outliers or rare events
- Long-tail behavior
- Rare categories that may not appear in the sample

So I’m considering an alternative approach using pandas chunking:

- Read the data with chunksize=1_000_000
- Define separate functions for:
- preprocessing
- EDA/statistics
- feature engineering

Apply these functions to each chunk

Store the processed chunks in a list

Concatenate everything at the end into a final DataFrame

My questions:

1. Is this chunk-based approach actually safe and scalable for ~30M rows in pandas?

2. Which types of preprocessing / feature engineering are not safe to do chunk-wise due to missing global context?

3. If sampling can lose data context, what’s the recommended way to analyze and process such large datasets while still capturing outliers and rare patterns?

4. Specifically for Google Colab, what are best practices here?

-Multiple passes over data?
-Storing intermediate results to disk (Parquet/CSV)?
-Using Dask/Polars instead of pandas?

I’m trying to balance:

-Limited RAM
-Correct statistical behavior
-Practical workflows (not enterprise Spark clusters)

Would love to hear how others handle large datasets like this in Colab or similar constrained environments",1768463055.0,9,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qddfz7/handling_30m_rows_pandascolab_chunking_vs/

1qd17gs,Many DE tasks and priorities to organize,"Where I work, there is no Scrum. Tickets keep coming in, and the coordinator distributes them and sets priorities. There are no sprints, because management frequently overrides priorities due to requests from the board and other management areas—almost on a daily basis. It’s basically a ticket queue that we execute as it comes.

During the day, I receive many different demands: validating data, mapping new tables, checking alerts from failed processes, discussions about possible data inconsistencies, reviewing PRs, helping interns, answering questions from people on other teams, etc.

Sometimes more than 10 people message me at the same time on Teams. I try to filter, organize priorities, and postpone what is not feasible to do on the same day, but more demands arrive than I can realistically handle, so tasks keep piling up.

We do have a team board, but I don’t like tracking everything there because some tasks are things like “talk to person X about Y” or “validate what person X did wrong,” which I don’t want to expose directly to colleagues and managers. So on the board I keep things more generic, without many comments

Lately, I’ve been putting everything into a single markdown file (tasks and personal notes). The most urgent items go to the top of the list as a simple TODO, but it keeps growing and sometimes it becomes hard to manage tasks and priorities

Naturally, there are tasks that never get done. My manager is aware of this and agrees that they should only be prioritized when it makes sense, but new ones keep coming in, and I miss having a tool where I could search for similar tasks or something along those lines

Have you ever faced this difficulty in organizing tasks? Do you have any tips for a simple workflow? I tried using some tools like Todoist and Taskwarrior, but I ended up preferring the ease of searching in a single file, even though it grows very large very quickly and eventually becomes messy and difficult to manage.

My Ducklake uses Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 for storage and Postgres as a metadata catalog.

Writing to ADLS has been possible since DuckDB version 1.4.3 and works wonderfully outside of my project.



Locally (via dg dev), I can run the Dagster asset without any problems so that data arrives in Ducklake.

Now I have the whole thing running in containers via Docker Compose (1 for logging, 1 for the web server, 1 for the daemon, and 1 for the codebase), and it is not working. The run can be started, but it breaks at the point of writing with the error messages: 

Error: IO Error: AzureBlobStorageFileSystem could not open file

and 

DuckDB Error: Fail to get a new connection for: https://xxxxxxxxx.blob.core.windows.net.

I have already run a separate container as a test, which runs with the same image as the Dagster codebase server and only executes the Python script of the asset. Everything works there. It seems to me that it only doesn't work in the Dagster project Docker context. 

Can anyone help me, because I'm getting pretty desperate at this point.

\- structured 

\- semi-structured

\- unstructured 

Dimensional modeling is still very relevant but will need to be augmented to include semi-structured outputs from the parsing of text and image data.

I have owned and delivered a significant and highly used 'customer 360' MDM data product as the main/sole data engineer in my team,  but my role is really just that - I don't do much else outside of Snowflake. We also don't use Dbt so I don't have any real world experience with that either.

  
Similar to another post made on here recently, I don't know how to do a lot of stuff that is mentioned on here simply because I've never had the chance to. I don't really know what containerisation is, I don't know how to spin up VM's, all the different Azure/AWS tools.

  
In terms of technical skills, I would rank myself as the following:

* SQL - Intermediate (maybe creeping into advanced here and there but I need AI help). I can write production level code
* Data modelling - beginner (can design/build a 3nf and star schema, I dont understand data vault)
* Python - I'm not specialised at all as we don't really use Python too much but I can write Python code well enough that it is understood by anyone, although it might not be optimal, and I can understand/copy most Python code I've seen. I have a few Python projects I've done over the years.
* APIs - no experience
* Kafka - understand the concepts but I find it so complicated. I've made a new topics and connectors with a lot of help.
* Dbt - 2 projects I've done on my own, no experience at work.
* Airflow - played around with it with some personal projects but nothing major - my team doesn't use it at work so I have no opportunity to
* CI/CD - fairly good understanding
* Documentation - I can make good documentation.",1768354762.0,19,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qca3r2/am_i_under_skilled_for_my_years_of_experience/

1qbx8ay,Data engineer with 4 years what do I need to work on,"Hi all,

I’m a data engineer with 4 years experience , currently earning £55k in London at a mid sized company.

My career has been a bit rocky so far and I feel like for various reasons I don’t have the level of skills that I should have for a mid level engineer , I honestly read threads on this sub Reddit and sometimes haven’t even got a clue what people are talking about which feels embarrassing given my experience level.

Since I’m the only data engineer at my company or atleast in my team it’s hard to know how good I am or what I need to work on.


Here’s what I can and can’t do so far

I can:
-Do basic Python without help from AI, including setting up and API call

-Do I would say mid level SQL without help from AI

-Write python code according to good conventions like logging, parameters etc

-Can understand pretty much all SQL scripts upon reading them and most Python scripts

-Set up and schedule and airflow DAG (only just learnt this though)

-Use the major tools in the GCP suite mostly bigquery and cloud storage

-Set up scheduled queries

-Use views in bigquery and set them up to sit on a looker dashboard

-have some basic visualisation experience with power bi and looker too

-Produce clear documentation



I don’t know how to:

-Set up virtual machines

-Use a lot of the more niche GCP tools (again I don’t even really know what I don’t know here)

-do any machine learning or data science 

-Do mid level Python problems list list 
comprehensions etc without help from AI

-Do advanced SQL problems without help from AI.

-Use AWS or azure

-Use databricks 

-Use Kafka

-Use dbt 

-Use pyspark

And probably more stuff I don’t even know I don’t know

I feel like my experience is honestly more around the 2 years sort of level,  I have been a little lazy in terms of upskilling but also had a couple of major life events that disrupted my career I won’t go into here

Where can I get the best bang for my buck so to speak upskill I f over the next year or so the trying to pivot for a higher salary somewhere else, right now I have no problem getting interviews and pass the cultural fit phase mostly as I’m well spoken and likeable but always fail the technical assesment  (0/6 is my record lol)",1768325094.0,71,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qbx8ay/data_engineer_with_4_years_what_do_i_need_to_work/

Apache Hudi's solution is ExternalSpillableMap - a hybrid structure that uses an in-memory HashMap until a threshold, then spills to disk. The interface is transparent: get() checks memory first then disk, and iteration chains both seamlessly.

Two implementation details I found interesting:

1. Adaptive size estimation: Uses exponential moving average (90/10 weighting) recalculated every 100 records instead of measuring every record. Handles varying record sizes without constant overhead.

2. Two disk backends: BitCask (append-only file with in-memory offset map) or RocksDB (LSM-tree). BitCask is simpler, RocksDB scales better when even the key set exceeds RAM.",1768321617.0,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qbvuxn/your_hashmap_ran_out_of_memory_now_what/

1qbs00s,"Is maintenance necessary on bronze layer, append-only delta lake tables?","Hi all,

I am ingesting data from an API. On each notebook run - one run each hour - the notebook makes 1000 API requests. 

In the notebook, all the API responses get combined into a single Dataframe, and the dataframe gets written to a bronze delta lake table (append mode).

Next, a gold notebook reads the newly inserted data from the bronze table (using a watermark timestamp column) and writes it to a gold table (also append).

On the gold table, I will run optimize or auto compaction, in order to optimize for end user queries. I'll also run vacuum to remove old, unreferenced parquet files.

However, on the bronze layer table, is it necessary to run optimize and vacuum there? Or is it just a waste of resources?

Initially I'm thinking that it's not necessary to run optimize and vacuum on this bronze layer table, because end users won't query this table. The only thing that's querying this table frequently is the gold notebook, and it only needs to read the newly inserted data (based on the ingestion timestamp column). Or should I run some infrequent optimize and vacuum operations on this bronze layer table?

For reference, the bronze table has 40 columns, and each hourly run might return anything from ten thousand to one million rows.

1qbilj6,Is my storage method effective?,"Hi all,

I’m very new to data engineering as a whole, but I have a basic idea of how I want to lay out my data to minimise storage costs as much as possible, as I’ll be storing historical data for a factory’s efficiency.

Basically, I’m receiving a large CSV file every 10 minutes containing name, data, quality, data type, etc. To save space, I was planning to split the data into two tables: one for unchanging data (such as name and data type) and another for changing data, as strings take up more storage.

My basic approach was going to be:  
**CSV → SQL landing table → unchanging & changing data tables**

We’re not yet sure how we want to utilise the data, but I essentially need to pull in and store the data before we can start testing and exploring use cases.

The data comes into the landing table, we take a snapshot of it, send it to the corresponding tables, and then delete only the snapshot data from the landing table. This reduces the risk of data being lost during processing.

The changing data would be stored in a new table every month, and once that data is around five years old it would be deleted (or handled in a similar way).

I know this sounds fairly simple, but there will be thousands of data entries in the CSV files every 10 minutes.

Do you have any tips or advice? Is it a bad idea to split the unchanging string data into a separate table to save space? Once I know how the business actually wants to use the data, I’ll be back to ask about the best way to really wow them.

1qasjr3,Need architecture advice: Secure SaaS (dbt + MotherDuck + Hubspot),"Happy Monday folks!

**Context** I'm building a B2B SaaS in a side project for brokers in the insurance industry. Data isolation is critical—I am worried to load data to the wrong CRM tool (using Hubspot)

**Stack**: dbt Core + MotherDuck (DuckDB).

    API → dlt → MotherDuck (Bronze) → dbt → Silver → Gold → Python script → HubSpot
    Orchestration for the beginning with Cloud Run (GCP) and Workflows

**The Challenge** My head is spinning and spinning and I don't get closer to a satisfying solution. AI proposed some ideas, which were not making me happy. Currently, I will have a test run with one broker and scalability is not a concern as of now, but (hopefully) further down the road.

I am wondering how to structure a Multi-Tenancy setup, if I scale to 100+ clients. Currently I  use strict isolation, but I'm worried about managing hundreds of schemas.

**Option A: Schema-per-Tenant (Current Approach)** Every client gets their own set of schemas: `raw_clientA`, `staging_clientA`, `mart_clientA`.

* ✅ **Pros**: ""Gold Standard"" Security. Permissions are set at the Schema level. Impossible to leak data via a missed `WHERE` clause. easy logic for `dbt run --select tag:clientA`.
* ❌ **Cons**: **Schema Sprawl**. 100 clients = 400 schemas. The database catalog looks terrifying.

**Option B: Pooled (Columnar)** All clients share one table with a `tenant_id` column: `staging.contacts`.

* ✅ **Pros**: Clean. Only 4 schemas total (`raw`, `stage`, `int`, `mart`). Easy global analytics.
* ❌ **Cons**: **High Risk**. Permissions are hard (Row-Level Security is complex/expensive to manage perfectly). One missed `WHERE tenant_id = ...` in a join could leak competitor data. Also incremental load seems much more difficult and the source data comes from the same API, but using different client credentials

**Option C: Table-per-Client** One schema per layer, but distinct tables: `staging.clientA_contacts`, `staging.clientB_contacts`.

* ✅ **Pros**: Fewer schemas than Option A, more isolation than Option B.
* ❌ **Cons**: **RBAC Nightmare**. You can't just `GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA`. You have to script permissions for thousands of individual tables. Visual clutter in the IDE is worse than folders.

**The Question** Is ""Schema Sprawl"" (Option A) actually a problem in modern warehouses (specifically DuckDB/MotherDuck)? Or is sticking with hundreds of schemas the correct price to pay for sleep-at-night security in a regulated industry?

1qamtsj,Automating ML pipelines with Airflow (DockerOperator vs mounted project),"Note: I already posted the same content in the MLOps sub. But no response from there. So posting here for some response.

Hello everyone,

Im a data scientist with 1.6 years of experience. I have worked on credit risk modeling, sql, powerbi, and airflow.

Im currently trying to understand end-to-end ML pipelines, so I started building projects using a feature store (Feast), MLflow, model monitoring with EvidentlyAI, FastAPI, Docker, MinIO, and Airflow.

Im working on a personal project where I fetch data using yfinance, create features, store them in Feast, train a model, model version ing using mlflow, implement a champion–challenger setup, expose the model through a fastAPI endpoint, and monitor it using evidentlyAI.

Everything is working fine up to this stage.

Now my question is: how do I automate this pipeline using airflow?

1. Should I containerize the entire project first and then use the dockeroperator in airflow to automate it?

2. Should I mount the project folder in airflow and automate it that way?

I have seen some youtube videos. But they put everything in a script and automate it. I believe it won't work in real projects with complex folder structures.

Please correct me if im wrong.",1768196748.0,6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qamtsj/automating_ml_pipelines_with_airflow/

1qahyip,Best Bronze Table Pattern for Hourly Rolling-Window CSVs with No CDC?,"Hi everyone, I'm running into bit of dilemma with this bronze level table that I'm trying to construct and need some advice. 

The data for the table is sent hourly by the vendor 16 times in the day as a CSV that has transaction data in a 120 day rolling window. This means each file is about 33k rows by 233 columns, around 50 MB. There is no last modified timestamp, and they overwrite the file with each send. The data is basically a report they run on their DMS with a flexible date range, so occasionally we request a history file so they send us one big file per store that goes across several years.

The data itself changes state for about 30 days or so before remaining static, so that means that roughly 3/4s of the data may not be changing from file to file (though there might be outliers).

So far I've been saving each file sent in my Azure Data Lake and included the timestamp of the file in the filename. I've been doing this since about April and have accumulated around 3k files.

Now I'm looking to start loading this data into Databricks and I'm not sure what's the best approach to load the bronze layer between several approaches I've researched.

Option A: The bronze/source table should be append-only so that every file that comes in gets appended. However, this would mean I'd be appending 500kish rows a day, and 192m a year which seems really wasteful considering a lot of the rows would be duplicates.

Option B: the bronze table should reflect the vendors table at the current state, so each file should be upserted into the bronze table - existing rows are updated, new rows inserted. The criticisms I've seen of this approach is that it's really inefficient, and this type of incremental loading is best suited for the silver/warehouse layer.

Option C: Doing an append only step, then another step that dedupes the table based on a row hash after a load. So I'd load everything in, then keep only the records that have changed based on business rules.

For what it's worth, I'm hoping to orchestrate all of this through Dagster and then using DBT for downstream transformations.

Does one option make more sense than the others, or is there another approach I'm missing? ",1768182682.0,9,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1qahyip/best_bronze_table_pattern_for_hourly/

1qaamfb,Low retention of bronze layer record versions and lineage divergence,"In the bronze layer, our business is ok (and desires) the clean up of older versions of records.  In fact, we can't guarantee that we'll be able to keep this history forever.  

We'll always keep active records and can always re-build bronze with active records.  

However, we do have gold level data and aggregate fact table, and it's possible that some of the records in gold could be from a snapshot in time.  

Let's say there are 3 records in a gold fact that summarize a total.  
Record 1: ID=1, ver=5 ,Amount=$100  
Record 2: ID=2, ver=5, Amount=$100  
Record 3: ID=3, ver=3, Amount=$50

There will be a point in time where this gold fact will persist and not be updated even if Record with ID=1 has a change in the amount in bronze layer.  This is by design and is a business requirement.

Eventually in bronze, record with ID=1 changes to ver=6 and Amount now=$110.

This time, we don't want to update the gold fact for this scenario, so it remains as ver=5.

Eventually, in bronze, due to retention, we lose the bronze record for ver=5, but we still keep v=6.  The gold still has a record of what the value was at the time and a record that it's based on the record being v=5.

The business is fine with it; and in fact they prefer it.  The like the idea of being able to access the specific version in bronze as it was at the time, but if it's lost due to retention then they are ok with that because they will just trust the number in the gold fact table; they'll know why it doesn't match source by comparing the version value.  

As a data expert, I struggle with it.  

We lose row-version lineage back to bronze, but the business is ok with that risk.  

As data engineers, how do you feel about this scenario?  We can compromise on the implementation, and I believe we are still ensuring trust of the data in other ways (for their needs) by keeping the copy of the record (what the value was at the time) in gold for the purposes of financial review and analysis.

1q9ylqb,Polars vs Spark for cheap single-node Delta Lake pipelines - safe to rely on Polars long-term?,"Hi all,

I’m building ETL pipelines in Microsoft Fabric with Delta Lake tables. The organizations's data volumes are small - I only need single-node compute, not distributed Spark clusters.

**Polars** looks perfect for this scenario. I've heard a lot of good feedback about Polars. But I’ve also heard some warnings that it might move behind a paywall (Polars Cloud) and the open-source project might end up abandoned/not being maintained in the future.

**Spark** is said to have more committed backing from big sponsors, and doesn't have the same risk of being abandoned. But it's heavier than what I need.

If I use Polars now, am I potentially just building up technical debt? Or is it reasonable to trust it for production long-term? Would sticking with Spark - even though I don’t need multi-node - be a more reasonable choice?

My latest project which I'm still finishing up. The point of this project was to actually deploy something real while keeping the costs close to 0 and to design an actual API. The DE part is getting the data from GitHub, storing it in S3, aggregating and then visualizing it. My worry is that this project might be a bit too simple and generic. 

[**Study-Time-Tracker-Python**](https://github.com/simon-milata/Study-Time-Tracker-Python)  
This was my first actual project and the first time using git so the code quality and git usage weren't great. It's also not at all something I would do at work and might seem too amateurish. I do think it's pretty cool tho as it looks pretty nice, is unique and even has a few stars and forks which I think is pretty rare.

[**TkinterOS**](https://github.com/simon-milata/TkinterOS)  
This was my second project which I made cause I saw GodotOS and thought it would be cool  to try to recreate it using Tkinter. It includes a bunch of games and an (unfinished) file system. It also has a few stars but the code quality still is still bad. Very unrelated to work too.  


I know this might feel out of place being posted on a DE sub but these are the only presentable projects I have so far and I'm mostly interested in DE. These projects were mostly made to practice python and make stuff.  
  
For my next project I'm planning on learning PySpark and trying Redshift / Databricks. My biggest issue is that I feel like the difficulty of DE is the the scale of the data and regulations which is very hard / very expensive to recreate. I also don't really want to make simple projects which just transform some fake data once.

1q9016g,"Rubber ducking a Bigquery, Airbtype, Looker strategy.","I'm piecing together a low cost data warehouse for a small-medium business. I'm basically the CTO and a generalist/developer/architect, and what I really lack in the data engineering  space is someone to bounce my ideas off.  
  
So please feel free to poke holes in any of this.

**Priorities**

* **High** \- Cost effective, low-code, avoid lock-in (eg OSS)
* **Low** \-  Performance, real-time

**Sources**

* Shopify Plus (customers, products, orders)
* GA
* Xero
* A subscription tool called SKIO with an AP**I**

**Why BigQuery**

I find it pretty cheap if you are judicious about what goes in it. So for example we have about 150k orders per year and I don't need line items because Shopify does that deeper analysis really well. BigQuery would eat that up out volume.

**Why Looker**

I think Looker is very cost effective and can plug in lots of stuff. For eg I can have Spreadsheets for some data and join it in Looker to BigQuery.

**Why AirByte**

A big part of this is deciding on an ETL. When I started we were using Celigo but found them to be pretty inflexible on billing. It's just a good example of lock-in I want to avoid.  
  
So I've been testing the Airbyte Shopify->BigQuery connector and it seems to do what i need. While it has the commercial solution, I feel confident I can switch to the community (open source) version later if I wanted to self host an ETL (which i think is a good long-term strategy in this day and age).

**Lock-in thoughts**

We are a Microsoft/Sharepoint place and while I don't dislike Azure I'm not a huge fan of Microsoft. We happened to already have Looker and GA because our Shopify vendor preferred it, and the business has never questioned this. So essentially I've put a Google Cloud strategy around these tools, and adding BigQuery is a bit of a no brainer. Obviously there is cloud lock-in to Google here, but in the massive event of Google dropping Looker/BigQuery I reckon we would survive as a business since most of our operational stuff is over in Shopify.

**Doubts**

The Shopify analytics platform is insanely good. If I could add some custom data to it I wouldn't be here writing this post. But I don't think that's in their business strategy to be a generic BI tool.

Unexpected costs are always a concern. Monitoring unexpected cloud costs, or regretting a SaaS product when you see ""Contact Sales for Pricing"" on some feature. I dunno if I can avoid that.

The problem is Power BI exports to PPT as images, so every small change means re-exporting the entire deck. One minor request can turn into multiple re-exports.

1q8q2un,Coco Alemana – Professional data editor that works with SQL and Amazon S3 natively,"Hi!

  
We've been building a tool that makes working with data extremely easy.

Specifically focused on the ad-hoc / last minute analytics segment, and data science (although using it for data engineering is totally possible too).

Some of the capability includes loading data from any source, cleaning, graphing it, writing raw SQL, exporting, etc.

A while back I posted on this forum about our ability to preview parquet directly from the OS... We've taken that and expanded it into this!



For those interested in the tech stack:

1. C++ for internal processing engine + DuckDB, Swift + AppKit for UI
2. Wrote our own custom caching engine, and SQL transpiler in C++. Transpiler takes DuckDB SQL and converts it into native SQL for full predicate pushdown (i.e. Athena, BigQuery, ClickHouse, Snowflake, Postgres, etc).
3. Wrote our own graphing library from scratch, all GPU native using custom shaders.
4. Wrote a custom Amazon S3 OS integration to replicate S3 buckets on Finder. Intercepts sys-level calls to reference remote data.
5. Super limited use of AI code. i.e. no vibe coding. Claude is high as a kite. Can't deal with that.

We've put a ton of effort into this, so hope you find it cool!

I am thinking of maintaining of a registry which maps each key to its respetive table. However as I tried to see how this approach works for some schemas I noticed that many table use same fields which are also unique, which means we can have same sharding key for mutiple tables.

meanwhile all our iceberg tables are in a proper catalog. we know what exists, who owns it, what the schema looks like. standard stuff.

  
started wondering - does lance even have catalog support? looked around and found that gravitino 1.1.0 (dropped last week) added a lance rest service. basically exposes lance datasets through http with the same auth as your other catalogs.



[https://github.com/apache/gravitino/releases/tag/v1.1.0](https://github.com/apache/gravitino/releases/tag/v1.1.0)



the key thing is gravitino also supports iceberg so you can have both your structured tables and vector datasets in one catalog. unified governance across formats. pretty much what we need

Although I enjoy the field, I've been studying and reflecting a lot about migrating to Data Engineering, mainly because I feel it connects much more with computer science, which is my undergraduate course, and with programming in general.

The problem is that I'm full of doubts about whether I'm going down the right path. At times, this has generated a lot of anxiety for me—to the point of spending sleepless nights wondering if I'm making the wrong choices or getting ahead of myself.

The company where I'm interning offers access to Google Cloud Skills Boost, and I'm taking advantage of it to study GCP (BigQuery, pipelines, cloud concepts, etc.). Still, I keep wondering:
Am I doing the right thing by going straight to the cloud and tools, or should I consolidate more fundamentals first?
Is it normal for this transition to start out ""confusing"" like this?

I would also really appreciate recommendations for study materials (books, courses, learning paths, practical projects) or even tips from people who already work as Data Engineers. Honestly, I'm a little lost — that's the reality. I identified quite a bit with Data Engineering precisely because it seems to deal much more with programming, architecture, and pipelines, compared to the more analytical side.

• Python

• SQL

• R

• Databricks (creating views to feed BI)

• A little bit of Spark

• pandas

I find myself in a bit of a predicament and hoping for some insight / opinions from you all.  
I have around four years experience as an analyst and almost a year in data engineering, but the role is extremely high-pressure and I've been burnt out for about the last 6 months, I'm just pushing hard to get through it. Note, I've spoken to my colleagues and they agree our workload definitly exceeds what the norm is in other companies, rather than this being a skill issue. I’ve been offered a six-month contract in a familiar area that is data related but significantly less stress and a role I have done before. I would earn my annual salary in 6 months and definitly get some mental health recovery, but I’m worried that stepping away from data engineering so early, especially given how fast the field and AI tooling are evolving, could make it difficult to re-enter as I would be unfamialir with the new tools / processes. I personally am quite worried about job security in the near to mid future and don't want to further damage my prospects. At my current role we are literally using and upgrading our AI tech stack on a weekly basis and it's hard enough to keep up while I'm in it, let alone if I leave the domain. All to say, with the constant improvements and upgrades in AI and essentially my current role shifting from programming and more to ideation and agent managment, would taking a break to make noticably more money and give me a mental health break be a bad idea due to the struggles of then re-entering the market.

* Quizzes to test your understanding
* Database design and implementation assignments
* Everything is free and open-access on GitHub

* Backend developers who want to move beyond CRUD operations
* Bootcamp grads who only got surface-level database coverage
* Self-taught engineers filling gaps in their knowledge
* Anyone who finds traditional DB courses too abstract

I originally created these videos for my own students when flipping my database course, and decided to make them freely available since there's a real need for accessible, practical resources on this topic.

1q7ef9r,Datacompose: Verified and tested composable data cleaning functions without dependencies,"# The Problem: 

I hate data cleaning with a burning passion. I truly believe if you like regex then you have Stockholm syndrome. So built a library with commonly used data cleaning functions that are pre verified that can be used without dependencies in your code base. 

 
Before:

```

# Regex hell for cleaning addresses
df.withColumn(""zip"", 
    F.regexp_extract(F.col(""address""), r'\b\d{5}(?:-\d{4})?\b', 0))
df.withColumn(""city"",
    F.regexp_extract(F.col(""address""), r',\s*([A-Z][a-z\s]+),', 1))
# Breaks on: ""123 Main St Suite 5B, New York NY 10001""
# Breaks on: ""PO Box 789, Atlanta, GA 30301""  
# Good luck maintaining this in 6 months

```

Data cleaning primitives are small atomic functions that you are able to put into your codebase that you are able compose together to fit your specific use ages. 

```

# Install and generate
pip install datacompose
datacompose add addresses --target pyspark

# Use the copied primitives
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
from transformers.pyspark.addresses import addresses

df.select(
    addresses.extract_street_number(F.col(""address"")),
    addresses.extract_city(F.col(""address"")),
    addresses.standardize_zip_code(F.col(""zip""))
)

```

All joins happen one after another on a unique customer ID.

Most tasks run fine but after all joins any action like count or display becomes painfully slow or sometimes fails. I’ve already increased executor memory and memory overhead, tweaked shuffle partition counts, repartitioned and persisted between joins, and even scaled the cluster to 2-8 workers with 28 GB RAM and 8 cores each. Nothing seems to fix it.

At first I thought it would be simple since the added tables are small. Turns out that the many joins combined with column renaming forced Spark to do broadcast nested loop joins instead of faster broadcast hash joins. Changing join types helped a lot.

Has anyone run into something like this in production? How do you usually handle multiple joins without killing performance? Any tips on caching, join strategies, or monitoring tools would be really helpful.

1q6w5sr,"Does your org use a Data Catalog? If not, then why?","In almost every company that I've worked at (mid to large enterprises), we faced many issues with ""the source of truth"" due to any number of reasons, such as inconsistent logic applied to reporting, siloed data access and information, and others. If a business user came back with a claim that our reports were inaccurate due to comparisons with other sources, we would potentially spend hours trying to track the lineage of the data and compare any transformations/logic applied to pinpoint exactly where the discrepancies happen.

I've been building a tool on the side that could help mitigate this by auto-ingesting metadata from different database and BI sources, and tracking lineage and allowing a better way to view everything at a high-level.

But as I was building it, I realized that it was similar to a lightweight version of a Data Catalog. That got me wondering why more organizations don't use a Data Catalog to keep their data assets organized and tie in the business definitions to those assets in an attempt to create a source of truth. I have actually never worked within a data team that had a formatlized data catalog; we would just do everything including data dictionaries and business glossaries in excel sheets if there was a strong business request, but obviously those would quickly become stale.

**What's been your experience with Data Catalog? If your organization doesn't use one, then why not (apart from the typically high cost)?**

My guess is the maintenance factor as it could be a nightmare maintaining updated business context to changing metadata especially in orgs without a specialized data governance steward or similar. I also don't see alot of business users using it if the software isn't intuitive, and general tool fatigue.

1q6uoz2,Advice - Incoming Meta Data Engineering Intern,"Hi everyone! I was recently fortunate enough to land a Data Engineering internship at Meta this summer and wanted to ask for advice on how best to prepare.

I’m currently a junior in undergrad with a background primarily in software engineering and ML-oriented work. Through research and projects, I’ve worked on automating ML preprocessing pipelines, data cleaning, and generating structured datasets (e.g., CSV outputs), so I have some exposure to data workflows. That said, I know production-scale data engineering is a very different challenge, and I’d like to be intentional about my preparation.

From what I’ve read, Meta’s approach to data engineering is fairly unique compared to many other companies (heavy SQL usage, large-scale analytics), and a lot of internal tooling. Right now, I’m working through the dataexpert .io free bootcamp, which has been helpful, but I’m hoping to supplement it with additional resources or projects that more closely resemble the work I’ll be doing on the job.

Ideally, I’d like to build a realistic end-to-end project, something along the lines of:

* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Extracting data from multiple sources
* Building a DAG-based pipeline
* Surfacing insights through a dashboard

# Questions:

1. For those who’ve done Data Engineering at Meta (or similar companies), what skills mattered most day-to-day?
2. Are there any tools, paradigms, or core concepts you’d recommend focusing on ahead of time (especially knowing Meta uses a largely internal stack)?
3. On the analytical side, what’s the best way to build intuition, should I try setting up my own data warehouse, or focus more on analysis and dashboards using public datasets?
4. Based on what I described, do you have any project ideas or recommendations that would be especially good prep?

The order of the clustered columns matter.

However when I ran a test, that doesn’t seem to be the case. 

I clustered my table on two fields (field1,field2)

Select count(*) from table where field2 = “yes” 

Resulted in 50gb of less data scanned vs the same query on the original table. 

Does anyone know why this would be the case?

1q6sbey,BigQuery? Expensive? Maybe not so much!,"Hey guys! Pleasure to meet you. I'm the CEO of [CloudClerk.ai](http://CloudClerk.ai), a startup focused on enabling teams to properly control their BigQuery expenses. Been having some nice conversations with other members of this subreddit and other related ones, so I figured I could do a quick post to share what we do in case we could help someone else too!

In CloudClerk we want to return to teams the ""ownership"" of their cost information. I like to make some stress on the ownership because we've seen other players in the sector help teams optimize their setup but once they leave, the teams are as clueless as before and need to contact them again in the future.

We like to approach the issue a bit differently, by giving clients all the tools they need to make informed decisions about changes in their projects. To do so we leverage 4 different elements: 

* **Audits** that are only billed based on success cases that we define together with clients. 
* **Mentoring services** to share our knowledge with employees of businesses.
* Our **platform** that allows to find, monitor and track the exact sources of cost (query X, table Y, reservations, etc) in less than 10 minutes.

>We expect to have ready by the end of the month necessary features like building custom dashboards from our exploring tool and having automatic alerting by analyzing trends of consumption based on different needs. We started as a service, so we are basically producticing all the elements that we used internally in a way where even a 6 year old could benefit from them.

* Our own **custom AI agents**, specialized in optimizing costs in BigQuery. Since we know IP & PII are deal breakers for some, we also built a protective layer that can be toggled on to ensure that actual data never gets to them, without hindering optimization recommendations.   

Clients should be able to, initially, find their sources of expenses and have automatic recommendations, and once fully embbeded, to not even need to find sources of expenses, but have direct explanations on what should be optimized and how to do so. Similarly, forget about getting alerts and debugging. If you get an alert, expect to have a clear explanation shortly after. 

These are just some of the things we will be implementing in the following weeks, but expect more updates in the near future! So far we've had very good results in cutting businesses costs, but more importantly, clients know how we did it and they can benefit from it. 

Would love to hear your opinion, thoughts, critics. Hit us up if you are curious, if you know this could help you, or even if you just want to have a quick chat with new ideas! 

Hope you have a great day and happy new year!

1q6ienl,Open-Source data and error tracking for Airflow,"I’m a SWE turned data engineer, long time lurker in this sub, and I’ve been using Airflow for a while now. One thing that’s consistently been a pain for me is monitoring: Airflow doesn’t give me a great way to track errors across DAGs/runs/environments, and setting up alerts with the included stats+prometheus always turns into a mini-project.

I tried the usual stuff:

* Airflow UI + logs + retries (fine for one-off debugging, rough for patterns)
* The common open-source Airflow + Grafana dashboards (I spent time wiring it up… then basically never used it)
* Sentry (I love Sentry as a SWE, and Airflow has integrations), but it still felt awkward because Sentry doesn’t really build around the concepts of  DAGs in the way I wanted, and I’d often end up with noisy/irrelevant errors + not enough context to quickly group recurring failures

So I built a self-hosted solution for myself (planning to open source it soon) with these features:

* 100% self-hosted: no data leaves your servers
* Easy install (Docker Compose + a lightweight Python SDK alongside Airflow)
* Operator-aware metrics: automatically integrate with popular operators to collect useful signals (e.g., row counts for SQL/dbt-ish tasks, file sizes/counts for S3-style tasks, etc.)
* Custom metrics in-code: a simple syntax to emit your own metrics right inside Airflow tasks when you need it
* Error tracking across DAGs + environments: aggregate/fingerprint failures so recurring issues are obvious (and you can fix them before they hit prod)
* Built-in alerting focused on data issues (currently: row count drops, schema changes, unexpected null counts)
* Notifications via SMTP or Resend (e.g., new errors / alert triggers)
* A modern and lightweight dashboard (Next.js)

Is this something other people are interested in, or did I just solve a ""me problem""?  
Are there any features or integrated alerts that would make this worth your while?

I was mostly doing POC s during my internship and was put on a very basic data cleaning client work - that mainly was similar to a small clg project involving xcel sheet of data that i had to clean using pandas / numpy and do some address validation)

Later i was put on an oracle to snowflake migration project where i was following orders from an architect. It was a 6  month project where i worked on breaking down the oracle logics that were 1000 lines of sql. Identifying where the joins were and basically

Broke down the whole hierarchy. It was financial data and involved 30 + tables. After that the architect drew out the entire data model structure for snowflake and we ran the ddl and created ddl for dims and facts. (Basically raw layer).

Then he gave us the logic to build out the following layers and we had to work on the logics together sometimes. He was not a pro on sql so he would just say- join this and this but we need this column to be used . Something like this.

We did all the typical stuff- developed in dev, moved to qa, did the testing all by ourself. We were 2 developers in the project. Who had to take ownership for everything snowflake related. 

Then came the client uat testing. So many arguments and so many questions. We had to take care of everything. It was cool to have ownership. Finally after making changes and testing vigourously we finally moved the data to prod env and then left the project.

Now I’ve been working with the ceo. Other clients are now catching up on the AI wave and want us to use ai in our daily workflow. But almost all of them in the company are resistant. I guess it’s a mix of no time, and fear of replacement. So the ceo wants me and one more person with similar background as me to push ai to these ppl. So my work has completely moved to vibe coding.

I work in a company where we offer a solution that covers both. To simplify: on one hand, some users need a tool to trace data and its evolution over time—this is data lineage, and it ties into accountability. On the other hand, you need visibility into the information (metadata) about that data, which is what a data catalog provides. This is usually in one solution package. 

From your experience, do you think having a combined solution is actually useful, or is it not worth it? If so, what do you use for data governance? ",1767784924.0,9,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q6cug2/data_lineage_data_catalog_could_be_a_unique_tool/
1q6862h,Warehousing for dataset with frequent Boolean search and modeling,"As the title states, I've got a large data set, but let's first  clarify what I mean by ""large"" -- about 1MM rows, unsure on total file size, estimating about a gig or two. Two tables.

I'm not a data engineer but I am sourcing this dataset from a python script that's extracting support ticket history via API and pushing to a CSV (idk if this was the best idea but we're here now...)

My team will need to query this regularly for historical ticket info to fill in gaps we didn't import to our new support system. I also will want to be able to query it to utilize it in reports.

We have metabase for our product... But I don't have much experience with it, not sure if that's an option??

Where can I host this data that isn't a fat .zip file that will break my team's computers?",1767767801.0,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q6862h/warehousing_for_dataset_with_frequent_boolean/
1q60wdp,Tools Rant,"if someone has experience with BigQuery and other ETL tools and the job description goes like needs Snowflake, Dagster etc.   
  
These tools don't match my what I have and yes I have never worked on them but how difficult/different would be grab things and move at a pace ? 

1. Do I have to edit my entire CV to match the job description ?

2. Do you guys apply for such jobs or you simple skip it ? If you do get through it how do you manage the expectations etc ?  ",1767747232.0,2,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1q60wdp/tools_rant/
