1qwgef1,3,"Ask follow-up questions. For each inquiry, you want to make sure:

1. Having the information is important. It’s not just “interesting to know” curiosity of someone, but something people will actually use. Numbers for sales deck, something to base a strategy on.

2. Having the information will actually make a difference. What outcome do you expect to get? Will your stakeholder’s action change if you get outcome A or outcome B? If the resulting action will be the same, why does it matter to know this information?

3. Is this a sort of a question that the stakeholders ask for repeatedly but in different circumstances, such as Number of stores in different countries or How long did this or that route take? If so, collect the questions and create a higher-level chart/dashboard with filters. Your goal: empower the stakeholders to answer the questions themselves

In general quick questions are a big part of being a data analyst and having a culture of colleagues asking for data and the using it is super valuable :)",5

Get good with vlookup, various IF statements, string splitting with FIND and LEFT/RIGHT, pivot tables, then maybe write a couple simple macros in VBA, then move on to SQL. 


In SQL, make sure you can do the same stuff you can do in Excel, that you understand all the joins, know when to use temp tables/CTEs, basic schema stuff, and can do some simple window functions like ROW_NUMBER()


Then move on to Python or PowerBI. After that you might be better served trying to get a DP-600 or DP-700 certification. You can probably save R for last.

Excel, you need the basics, stats formulas, pivot tables, and lookups which also could take a month if you have no experience. 

Assuming you don’t need any of these tools right away, I’d do a month or 2 of basic excel, then learn SQL fully for 2 months, then one of the viz softwares for 2 months or so, then python, which will take the longest and it’s the most unnecessary/advanced (6 months to get decent?) - pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy.

You can now submit narrative prompts and data to Copilot and it will run Python in the background, spit out an answer, provide the code, and walk you through the analysis and results. The prompts need to be sufficiently detailed, but if done correctly you can build an analysis pipeline without ever coding. I’ve cleaned data, built simulations, simple analyses, etc, with few hiccups (all verified running the code in R).

I prefer R because in my field (quantitative ecology) there are a lot more packages devoted to the types of data common in my field.

I don’t do a lot of SQL but can get by; if I maintained enduring sets that accrued new data over time, I’d probably want to learn more.

I’ve sworn off Tableau, PowerBI, and app development because I hate trying to figure out how others are going to fail when using the tools I build. There is a very real human-computer interface psychology that I cannot figure out to my satisfaction.

The upshot is, I’d probably figure out what I was hoping to do with the skills I’ve learned.

1qv3ljs,4,"Just exclude dirty data. Your business users will suddenly be very interested in improving their unit data quality 😂 I’m only half-joking 😅

But seriously, firstly I would work with the DBAs to enforce restrictions on fields if you can (e.g. use data types properly), then I’d look at input methods (e.g. data validation in Excel), and then I’d start looking at the data itself. As a general rule, be non-destructive in your transformations, and where possible tackle issues one-by-one in whatever tool you’re using (like one cell per transformation in a Python notebook). I always start with getting the data types right, that solves a whole bunch of issues. Then I actually prefer running exception reports to data quality rather than “cleaning” data if possible. You can go down a really huge rabbit hole with cleaning, and it’s really much more robust to fix it in source.

At enterprise level, thinking about data cleaning as a *system* is more robust than doing individual operations.",1
1qv3ljs,5,"Data cleaning is really just prepping each dataset. Proper formats, correct types, deduplication, fixing null percentages, that kind of thing.

I believe there are tools out there that reduce the time you have to clean messy data and provide logic for tackling these scenarios. Some agentic AI tools can map out the inconsistencies and suggest cleaning approaches without over processing.

Some of these tools actually helped me understand the concept and dive deeper into how I should process each dataset and think of alternate ways to improve. This is all preference but feel free to share how you usually tackle these problems.",1

There's nothing fancy going on.",5
1qssxpn,2,"I think in anything you want to track you want to first define what success looks like in a specific scenario. 

It could be click through rate if you’re looking at some kind of app it could be low churn percentage in any service, the numbers of whatever units they are processing, their processing rate, delivery time etc.",2
1qssxpn,3,"You should get comfortable creating your own metrics. By itself metrics are meaningless

Generally this goes in the following order:  
1. What is the actual business goal?  
2. What are potential signals for this goal?  
3. Pick the strongest signals.

Example... We created a new feature at Reddit and want to know how well this feature performs.

So first I need to define success. Business success might be: people engage with Reddit more.

Signals then might be:

\- amount of sessions in a week  
\- average (active) time in a session  
\- amount of posts read  
\- amount of comments  
\- amount of messages  
\- etc etc

So we then need to re-define the most important ones. Maybe we say; comments don't say much, because a lurker is a user to. Thus we scrap that. Sessions in a week might not matter to, because we don't know whether they just opened the app for 1 second. Same with posts, did they actually read it or quickly open it. 

So we might have a concept of 'valuable session' which would be a combination of metrics we define. Like when do we consider a session valuable?

Then that can be turned into a metric; valuable sessions / user

And if we want to be fancy we could do a differences in differences approach and only release the feature in some countries to see whether our metric goes up in that country, but not in the others. 

As a data analyst in product it is very important that you bring this complex quant thinking. Because in this time and age everyone is an analyst to some extent. You need to be better than them and be able to think strategically about metrics.",2

For a competent data analyst these repetitive tasks take a few minutes to automate (Power Query or whatever), and then can be verified and validated easily. Once done, some simple checks are all that are needed to make sure script has executed correctly in future.

So such AI tools are only really useful for absolute beginners. The problem is such people don’t know how to verify and validate such analysis, and so the analysis basically becomes useless anyway. It therefore needs to be checked by someone who know what they’re doing - so you still need to employ someone competent, at which point they could do what AI did but more competently and professionally, and with more confidence in the result, in about the same time.

Separately, I’ve been building a side project aimed at giving AI agents more deterministic data tooling, rather than having the model manipulate data directly. The idea is that the AI plans and orchestrates, but the actual data processing runs in a separate program, so raw data never needs to be passed to the model itself. It currently integrates with Claude Desktop and VS Code Copilot, and is very much still evolving, but I’ve found the agent + real tools split works much better for serious analysis than pure prompt-based approaches.

1qpdt43,4,"This is not exactly what you're asking for but I made a streamlit app for my portfolio recently that cleans data and build a custom data contract.  I find your use case pretty interesting, and if you tell me a little bit more about it, I might be able to build it for you in the coming weeks.  I'm presently working on a new portfolio piece in the aviation space but when I wrap that up, I'll be looking for something new. 

Are you basically saying you want to be given a dirty data set, you clean it, and then you get feedback on it? Do you want to do the cleaning in the application or you trying to do that cleaning locally on your system and then upload the clean data set validation and feedback? 

Feel free to DM me, I'm not trying to commercialize anything, I just really enjoy making small data applications for my portfolio and cleaning is one of my favorite steps even if it's generally looked at as rather boring.

1qpd0hv,1,"I do this for a real bank. 

In the ideal world, you'll work with stakeholders, explain what you're seeing and come up with a plan to adjust. Analayze again after initiatives have been implemented to gauge effectiveness. If you want to go down the data science route, then you start to determine what combination of factors predict churn and build models to try and stop it. 

In the real world, you have countless meeting where people pound the desk and say what a great analysis it was and how they are going to make changes, but without any way to enforce accountability, you'll see the same churn numbers next year.",21
1qpd0hv,2,"You'll want to look at segmentation. Is churn higher in a certain country? Is churn higher for a certain age group? So far you've answered these questions. But is there a certain age group in a certain country where churn is highest? Or, are there certain countries where age group doesn't matter? Or, is there one country where churn is highest in older age groups, but another country where churn is highest in younger age groups.

Then add other features to this, and you get the idea.

There are multiple ways of doing this. If you've never looked at anything like this before, the first thing I recommend is an introduction to the Chi Squared test. This test compares observed outcomes to expected outcomes, for a categorical variable and an outcome. E.g. Male / Female compared to Churn Yes / No.

After that, do an introduction to Decision Trees.

What you'll want to do is choose some sort of algorithm that applies a test (e.g. Chi Squared) to all possible categoric variables. Once the best indicator is found, take your categories (e.g. Male, Female) and then proceed to test all remaining categories again (Male, USA; Male, Canada; Male, EU; Female, USA; Female, Canada; Female, EU). As well as the remaining categories like Male / Female and Age Group.

Between Country / Age Group / etc. choose the best category.

Repeat again and again until you either reach a maximum desired depth, segment size, or number of segments.

  
I think this kind of algorithm is the best place to start as you can conceptualise it very well, rather than jumping into a clustering algorithm.

A few algorithms to consider would be (Google's AI Overview):

CART

* **Recursive Binary Splitting:** The algorithm starts with the entire dataset and selects the best feature and split point (a rule, e.g., ""Age > 30"") that maximizes homogeneity in the target variable within the resulting segments.
* **Tree Structure:** The process repeats recursively, creating a tree with nodes, branches, and leaf nodes. The terminal leaf nodes represent the final segments.
* **Splitting Criteria:**
   * **Classification:** Uses **Gini Impurity** or **Entropy** to measure node purity.
   * **Regression:** Uses **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** or **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.
* **Stopping Rules:** To prevent overfitting, the tree stops growing when it reaches a maximum depth, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or when further splits do not significantly improve homogeneity. 

  
CART vs. Other Methods

* **Vs. CHAID:** While both are decision trees, CART produces strictly binary splits (two branches per node), whereas CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) can produce multiple splits.
* **Vs. Cluster Analysis (e.g., K-Means):** CART is supervised (uses a target variable to define segments), while cluster analysis is unsupervised (finds natural groupings without a pre-defined target). ",7

Your average accuracy shows a decline. But variance might be shrinking at the same time. Which means in general, you are more consistently accurate, even though the average accuracy is a lower mean. (just a assumption as example, doesn't mean this is actually happening)

So I'd be careful when plotting it with rolling averages, and instead look at variances - e.g. repeated measures style - rather than averages.

1qox87g,1,"As long as the data is reasonably realistic, I don't see a major problem here. If I'm hiring for a data analysis position, I really want to get a sense of how the candidate thinks about and goes about solving problems and how well they can communicate and visualize their findings. I don't care that much about the specific outcomes, correlations, or results. **Seeing the candidate's process is much more important than the results**. Also, even for experienced analysts, many real-world projects can't be used for portfolio purposes because of proprietary/confidential/protected information. My portfolio has had several different projects in it that drew upon actual work, but used wholly synthetic data due to the real data being protected under HIPAA or FERPA. 

I would caution against building a specific use case for an industry or application you're not familiar with. I know plenty of capable analysts who thought they could come up with projects or examples in my industry that certainly looked good—but also showed an utter failure to understand what the data means, what matters, and what the real *business* questions are in my industry. I wouldn't begin to think I could generate something meaningful for the automotive or life insurance industries without first gaining a deeper understanding of those industries.

The main thing is just being open about it. Say it’s synthetic and that you built it to simulate a realistic business case. Recruiters care much more about seeing your process - how you clean data, explore patterns, and explain insights - than whether the dataset came from a real company.

Just treat it as a practice sandbox, not “real-world truth,” and it comes across well.

The AI argument, is like saying why learn math as an engineer when I have a calculator? Or why learn history when I can google it.

It helps you to improve your mental model of the world, it updates your map of the territory so it’s more in line with the reality.

As a data scientist and engineer I use AI, but god knows it’s not perfect. I also have a hard time seeing anyone looking at code written by AI and confirm that it’s correct or not if they don’t even know the syntax.

Syntax is more than just text and symbols. It tells you how to structure stable and maintainable code.

And the skill itself to write code and liking to write code is probably connected to other traits that goes well in hand with the role.

It also shows you how well your resume and experience matches the job description. I land interviews like crazy (atleast the screening rounds). I can also keep track of the lifecycle of the jobs I applied to. I don’t use LinkedIn anymore due to the fear of bot jobs. But this app I think does a pretty good job of posting recent, new jobs. 

I landed a DA job making 60% more than what I was making. Found the job on the app. 

Disclaimer: you still have to have strong DA skills and the ability to interview well. Both come with practice. But if you want to give yourself a better shot at atleast getting to the screening then I swear by this app.

Here are some questions: 

Do I absolutely need SQL and Python before I can get a dedicated data related role? 

I've been seeking opportunities where I can gain more experience or just snag a role and work my skills up in said role. I'm even open to volunteering or even side hustles so I can grow my skillset.

Maybe football or other sports (I’m sure there’s lots of open data on that), geographic or weather data you could solve a problem relating to outdoor activities like hiking or sailing if that’s you’re interest. 

IMO real data is better because it shows you the real issues you can encounter and how to clean them, and shows you are able to find data which are more important skills than running a query, in a DA role and to an inteviewer. The reason to choose a hobby you’re interested in is choosing a niche helps you narrow down and find data sources, and with the knowledge and interest you have you can come up with interesting business problems to solve with analysis and be motivated to dig deeper.

AI generated data tends to remove those failure modes, which makes the project less realistic. A common middle ground is to take a public dataset and design a normalized schema around it, then explain the tradeoffs you made.

In practice Python plus SQL covers most analytics roles, while R is more niche and worth learning later only if the job or team clearly uses it.",56
1qcl9cn,2,"I mean, I use Python almost exclusively for data analysis, with SQL queries as string inputs. So I guess, personally, I start using Python the moment data is available, and it ends with the production of results/insights to share. Then it is passed on to Google Docs/Google Sheets/Google Slides/LucidChart/Confluence, depending.",8
1qcl9cn,3,"Great question - you’re already thinking strategically about your learning path, which is smart.

Python becomes essential when you need to do stuff SQL can’t handle well - think machine learning, advanced statistical modeling, automation, API integrations, and complex data transformations. Most data analysts use it for data cleaning (pandas), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and automating repetitive tasks.

Your intro Python knowledge is actually a solid foundation. You’ll pick up more as you need it on the job. The beauty of Python is you learn it as you solve problems, not just in isolation.

Python vs R
Python is usually enough. It’s more versatile (not just for stats), has better job market demand, and integrates better with production systems. R is powerful for statistical analysis specifically, but Python + libraries like scipy and statsmodels cover most analytics needs. Unless you’re going into hardcore academic research or specific industries that love R, stick with Python for now.

Before you invest more time in advanced Python courses, make sure you’re solid on SQL fundamentals first - that’s still your bread and butter as an analyst. Most analytics roles are 70% SQL, 20% Python, 10% other tools.

Good luck with the bootcamp!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",6
1qcl9cn,4,"It depends. 

I use Python for anything regarding statistical analysis or machine learning. Some things you either can't really do with SQL (e.g. working with a probability distribution like a binomial), or just aren't really effective in SQL.

As for the difference in Python and R, there isn't much in terms of what it can do. The main benefit that Python has is that it is more versatile, you could even build a website with it.

Benefit of R is that a lot of academic resources use R packages, and with books they generally write it in R. So in terms of statistics it has WAY more options. Though, that doesn't mean you can't do the same with python.",9

In SQL I write relatively simple queries and aggregations. It is okay as a quick hack (e.g. on Palantir Foundry it is easier just to write a simple SQL query to do some basic filtering etc.) but in general, most data manipulations are being done in Python and R.

A few notes:

1. I’m assuming slo, Santa margarita are to the right of Grover, I’d swap that entire line to a multi select drop down instead of a horizontal line. Unless you are going to deep dive into them later and those are the links. Then I’d make them into the first page in a grid or something so you can select them and go to the “deep dive”

2. What’s your data? I don’t buy that the max housing price is 774k if cambria is in the data set. You should have the years in the title something like. Real Estate Market SLO County YEARS

3. ASSUMING your data is correct the average price by location chart scale is off. It looks super off seeing everything in 0.XX Million. Swap it to hundreds of thousands. 

4. All of your price numbers need a unit. I assume they are all in dollars but since the max price is 774k if you told me it was in Pounds I’d believe you. 

5. The count of properties chart is super weird. It looks like you created the variable as a factor but didn’t give it proper levels. The legend at the bottom of the chart starts goes 3, 4, 2…. I’d expect this to go in order (1,2,3,…). 

5a. It also looks like you’re allowing the data to just be the data without doing a roll up. Traditionally when looking at housing bedrooms you would show 0,1,2,3,4,5+ as anything with more than 4 bedrooms is pretty rare (DEPENDING ON THE AREA) 

6. The location map isn’t centered around the county that you are talking about so it feels really out of place, I also don’t know what the value is of having it in the dash board would love to know why you added it. 

7. The insights are… lacking. For an early attempt in building a dashboard 100% fine but I would scrap the section and use the space for something else

8. I hate this color palette. It makes your donut chart almost unreadable. I’m a massive fan of simplicity in theme and using the 508 guidelines as general rules to improve readability. 

9. Feel free to ask if you want me to clarify anything :)

So your best answer is to explain that they're two sides of the same coin - the data model is the backend relational database built into Excel that can handle millions of rows and complex relationships, and Power Pivot is the frontend interface where you actually create those relationships, build measures with DAX, and manage your data tables.

The interviewer is probably testing whether you actually understand the Excel BI ecosystem or if you're just throwing around buzzwords. Show them you get the distinction by mentioning that you can technically have a data model without ever opening Power Pivot (like when you create relationships through regular PivotTables), but Power Pivot gives you the full power to leverage the data model's capabilities with calculated columns, measures, and KPIs.

You could do that with a sentence or two at the top or add the functionality in filtering or visual drill downs. (ie filter for a couple of diseases at a time etc...)

Consider combining two of your line charts to show something like prevalence vs mortality or mortality vs recovery. The intersections of those data points might be more interesting rather than being separated. I would recommend adding conditional formatting with a gradient to the vertical bar chart so the countries at the top have a darker color than those at the bottom. It's an easy way to add style and draw the reader's eye to the most important data. Lastly, for your scatter plot maybe use a different symbol because the triangle makes it hard to read. 

Also, the first thing that jumps out at me is ""Green"", and it's somewhat distracting. I can understand if its a theme choice but you might want to make green more of a secondary color.

1q9anqi,3,"Limited time is usually best dealt with a prioritization que to start. Work on the highest priority and when completed go to the next until time runs out.  That can hopefully get to a stabilization (somethings never get done, but time is used most wisely) where further adjustments can be made to improve the situation for DA and the rest of the business.   

I have found Sharepoint and Teams to be shit at version tracking. There's a log there, but frequently a large portion are changes that shouldn't have been made in the first place.  The documents are usually set up with too permissive a set of write permissions.  There are items where the scheme can make sense, but it is rarely for DA type activities and reporting.  Kill the ability of anyone to write to a report file but one (or two for backups) designated report owners.  All changes must go through them.  Changes need to be put into the report owners prioritization scheme.   

I would guess that your team is producing too many dashboards for a start. Most answers to business questions for most companies should come in a form other than a dashboard.    

I'd be checking to see how many of these dashboards are getting used and by how many people.  I'd use that information in helping prioritize what gets worked on, and then I'd try to see if there are simpler methods of answering the questions that are needed.  

Potentially great or potentially a major risk depending on the context of your business: See if you can get counting to charge back your time to the requester's department as a cost.  That will likely drive requests down quickly to ones that are meaningful and truly desired.",1
1q9anqi,4,"You need to have honest conversations about the decisions that those reports are for.  When you keep adding and wasting time on menial design matters, it distracts from the goal.

Storytelling with Data is a book that goes into detail on the concept of cognative load and how people overcomplicate their reportings and in the end they just become overwhelming and under utilized.

Dashboards are meant to help keep pulses on specific things that help people make specific decisions.  It's not meant to be an EKG that monitors 100 unrelated things.

Ask yourself who keeps asking for changes.  Are they separate teams?  Are they using separate pieces of the report?  Do they even look at the rest or do they just deviate to their specific part?  Do the various changes actually matter to the goal?

And if the tons of changes arent making a meaningful impact to the decision aspect of the report or its just some obscure nice to have, you just have to say no.

And you can do that nicely by refocusing the conversation to: what business decisions will this addition impact?  Why is this necessary and what impact does it drive?

And sometimes its better to turn these dashboards into actionable stories.  Instead of everything in one place, maybe curate a dashboard to a specific story and separate other stories so users can navigate to the one most relevant to them instead of going to the kitchen sink.

Then find a way to automate those tools so your analyst dont have to manage them too much.  Like scheduled programs to refresh reports, Tableau or Power BI automated refreshes.  You can even build templates in Excel to automate things for easier refresh.

Key is you need to be very intentional on how you push data forward and learn to say no to every request.  If you dont have time to do meaningful analysis, you are letting turn you into a report junkie.",1

PDFs are tricky. text extraction works well for digitally generated tables, but scanned PDFs are basically a different beast since OCR is slow and memory-heavy in the browser. Users also expect perfect CSVs, but most tables need a bit of manual cleanup, so showing a preview saves a ton of frustration (Power BI does a good job at this cleanup step). 

You can parse a PDF table using structural tags or some sort of heuristic. I decided to make mine start with searching for tags and fall back to heuristics (col width, data similarity, etc).

1q88mv0,1,"Answering this in a strictly data science context, which is quite different from my work on data pipelines.

Suppose I'm doing some exploratory work in a dataset. I'd start by importing the data into SQL and doing some initial querying with a SQL client, to answer some basic questions... did it import gracefully (data looks correct, not wrapped in quotes, didn't offset columns, didn't treat header row as data...)? How many rows? What columns? 

If I imported an unfamiliar dataset, I likely just imported everything as nvarchar(255). Now that I see the shape of the data, I'll probably create a new table with fields that match the data types and shove the data into that table. This is also when I'll have given the table an arbitrary ID as primary key if it doesn't already have one.

This is a good time to add indexes. 

Then, more exploration. If it's time series data, what date/time range? What's the data resolution (is it 10 records per hour, a million...)? Or perhaps it's location data - what locations? What states, or counties, or cities, or zipcodes? At this stage I just want to understand what I'm looking at.

More indexes.

Now let's suppose I understand pretty well what my dataset is. I may want to create some new columns that are derived from the others. I might pull dates or years out of time series data. I may add some categorical columns or rankings.

And now I'm ready to fire up python. Jupyter's a good choice here, as I can run little snippets of python code and get results back, see visualizations, etc. So in my jupyter project I'll use pandas and matplotlib in much the same way I was using SQL - I'm looking to understand my data, now with some visual elements that help me understand things like how numbers behave over time, or in relation to other variables, or whatever it is I'm looking for in this data.

Then maybe there are models to be built, or who knows what else.

Even at this stage, I'm still toggling back to my SQL client frequently to do sort of data administration work, which I'll keep organized to maintain a clear path from raw data to my end result. This isn't every query and python statement I ran in order - I frequently prune and refactor so that decision points are clearly documented, but a person reproducing the work (likely me at a later date) wouldn't have to follow every mental dead end I had to take to get from one end to the other.",74
1q88mv0,2,"I use SQL to get the data I need for my task. This is either by going into Big Query to run the query and export to CSV. Or I can connect my Python notebook to Big Query and run the SQL query via Python. 

For either, the next step is read the data into a Pandas dataframe (I’m also starting to dabble in Polars) and then do my EDA, maybe a little bit more cleaning and transformation, and then whatever my output is (model or visuals or something else). 

However, sometimes Python is not the right tool - sometimes I can complete my task in Excel (basic data analysis and visualization on a small amount of data) or Tableau (if I need a dashboard with refreshing data). All of the data I use lives in my company’s data warehouse, so these tasks still start with SQL to get the correct data that I need for my task.",17
1q88mv0,3,"What has helped me decide when to use SQL versus Python is to first understand the underlying resources used and the design intent of SQL vs Python beyond just the query language (SQL) versus general purpose language (Python et el) debate.






You'll often hear the phrase ""SQL for the heaving lifting"". What they mean by that is the SQL database engine or server is optimized to handle or crunch large data.  The reason being, they are running on powerful machines, far more powerful than your work laptop that your Python process is running on.  Once you've reduced your data to a smaller, more manageable size (say after summarizing your data like with a GROUP BY resultset), then you can optionally leverage Python/PowerBI/Tableau/Excel/etc on these smaller, summarized data sets and perform exploratory data analysis and visualizations.






Python process typically is an in-memory process that runs on your local machine.  The consequence of this is that it is limited to the amount of memory and compute resources of that local machine.  So you'll have to be conscious of the size of the data or else run the risk of getting out-of-memory errors.  I cant give you specific heuristics on what is ""too big"" for your particular Python setup because it depends on various factors beyond just knowing how much free RAM memory is available.  Certain Python libraries are more optimized for what I call small to medium data (small: less than half the size of available RAM, medium: data that will fit on your hard disk drive).  Pandas for instance is usually more suitable for smallish data and polars more suitable for medium data.  There are also other techniques like chunking or streaming that you can use also for medium data.  Then you have multi-machine or distributed compute frameworks like PySpark to handle big data where you're leveraging multiple machines' compute power.






Other aspects to consider is what I would call the tediousness of doing something with SQL vs Python.  There are certain same things that you can accomplish with both SQL and Python, but certain Python libraries' API's syntax have convenient one-liner functions versus having to write a paragraph of SQL for the equivalent thing you want to achieve in SQL.  But of course, you need to have a Python environment installed on your local machine.  In some companies or organizations, that in itself can be a hurdle or not a cultural fit.






One final aspect I would like to mention is when Python is refered to as a ""glue language"" or as a systems integration language.  What is meant by that, is a result or consequence of the wide range of data related libraries that are available for the Python language.  Since data come in many forms or reside in many different storage systems or technologies, when it comes to automation or integrating data from disparate source systems, this is where Python is extremely useful.  You have data, but you can only access it with ODBC?  JDBC?  JSON data from an API endpoint?  Dont want the hassle of importing a csv into a database just to take cursory peek at it?  Dont worry there is a Python library for all those scenarios.  With these example scenarios, it is easy to see why Python is a popular choice for glueing or integrating things together.






TL/DR - So in a nutshell, I would say, use SQL for the heavy lifting (ie large data processing) and Python where it makes sense (automation, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, tediousness of SQL vs Python).",15

1q88mv0,6,"I've worked in ETL, not exactly data science/analyst but adjacent. The answers here are super valuable, but the honest answer is ""it depends"". It depends on the data shape + volume, the performance characteristics of the machines that the SQL database and python code are run on, it depends what kind of SQL database you're using and its features, it depends on emerging features in the latest versions of python you're using, and it depends on ""how much time can I spend optimizing this?"" vs. ""when is it good enough.""

SQL and Python have enough overlapping features* that they can both ""get the job done"" in the timeframe you have to do the task.

Answering these questions is the full-time job of many people working in big data. Knowing the tools and building intuition about them will keep you employed for decades.

If you're looking to answer this in the short term and you have time to learn, my answer would be, ""try both."" If you don't have time, use the one that you already know how to use.

NHANES can help for population level labs, but it is not great if you want report style interpretation or longitudinal patient narratives. Another common approach is generating synthetic lab reports based on real distributions, which avoids privacy issues but introduces its own validation gaps. The failure mode tends to be training an LLM on labs without enough clinical context and then overestimating its interpretive reliability.

1q7h8qc,1,"I think, and I'm not sure here, but this is a question of audience. VP's and directors need to see the data to approve budget, and assign teams to work on the problem. Architects need to design the solution. Engineers need to actually implement the solution. Each set of stakeholders might find motivation in the metrics. Are you getting your metrics in front of all those stakeholders?

If you show the metrics to just one set of those stakeholders then the solution is never going to materialize. Depending on your situation, you might need to display slightly different versions of the same metric to different group. There might be some 'translation' needed.

I'm supporting a Data Warehouse with Diagnostic data and metrics that help them tell what their own system is doing (in my case an ETL, but maybe expanding to the OLTP as well). The metrics should at least take the manual of a process of monitoring off the team members. Given that I have that 10,000 foot view that the Engineers in the trenches don't have, I'm also a attending many Discovery meetings. Writing up a couple projects. And using the metrics to give solid reasoning behind the project proposal is a solid way to inject testable actionable work into the development cycle.
