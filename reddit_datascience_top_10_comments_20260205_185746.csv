1qx11ri,1,"In general I think causal inference / MMM is more difficult practically and has less financial upside than like ML engineering. The reason to do causal inference is because you love it.

If you do love it though, you should DM me because we are in the space and love to hire people who are passionate about causal inference.",1
1qx11ri,2,"What country are you in and industry ?

Sounds like if you’ve been in 5 years, it’s the decision to specialise on a technical level or take on more of a management role?

I look at the manager two levels above me, they aren’t really doing any actual work themselves, it’s just meetings and setting broad strategy, they aren’t writing any code, just reviewing presentations",1
1qx11ri,3,"As someone that do both types of work (we use ML and causal models in rec sys and personalization), this should not be an “either … or …” question. In my domain, you’re expected to know both types of science work. 

If you feel you’ve plateaued in ML, take the causal inference job and in the future, you can apply to jobs that allows you to combine both methods.",1
1qx11ri,4,"From a recent review of job ads compared to 3y ago, there's a lot more ML engineer jobs or mlops dev roles than data scientist roles. I take that to bean that the experimenting / bespoke dev stuff is dying out and being replaced by mlops architecture and plug/play models. Not sure what that means in your scenario - I'm sure mmm can be systematised, but I reckon the ol' creative juices aspect will be hard to replace with LLM written so may have better longevity? 🤷",1
1qwz1yi,1,"Just because engineers cannot manage to write good evals... because shocker, they are not trained in measurement and creating measures of latent concepts and fuzzy concepts, .... that does not mean we have to use AI to write evals. It's a a circle in which because you cannot write evals, you use AI to write evals and then you use AI to write evals to evaluate the system that wrote evals. It's insane.

Just hire someone who is an expert in measurement. That exists in social science.

Being in the inside and seeing engineers create the dumbest stuff like ""meaningful"" or ""helpful"" is mind boggling. And the choices/options for those make no sense whatsover either.",7

1qv95en,1,"This is the difference between academia data science and industry data science. If the model generates impact, nothing else matters.",286
1qv95en,2,"Just because a model is good or generates a lot of revenue, doesn't mean it's perfect or that every decision that went in to producing it was the right decision. I work with a model that also generates millions in revenue. It had a bug in it. We fixed the bug but even with the bug, it still generated millions. That doesn't mean bugs are good.

Unless you know what the model's metrics were before backwards elimination was used to select features, you can't really say what the effect of backward elimination is on model performance.

Backwards elimination is perfectly defensible in plenty of situations. It's usually a reasonable, practical step to throw a lot of features into a model to begin with and backwards elimination can obviously get rid of some features that are doing nothing or not very much.

I think there's very few of these kinds of techniques that are always good or always bad. The bottom line is, if you think something's a good idea or a bad idea, test it and find out. What people ""reckon"" about these things without being able to back it up isn't worth much.",93
1qv95en,3,"Every model is wrong, but some are useful",62
1qv95en,4,"Why not just use lasso to more quickly identify useless features though?


I come from academia to industry and my first thought was what most people said, rigor vs practicality.


But coming from academia, I see a lot of lazy non empirical shit. 


Idk why someone dropped certain features two years ago, but today they are highly significant. If they'd use an empirical programmatic solution in the first place, I wouldn't be here trying to understand why they dropped the third most significant feature. 


Or something like that.",25
1qv95en,5,"In academia, statistical models are typically used to test hypotheses derived from theory. This means the researcher begins with a belief that a specific relationship exists between a set of variables and an outcome of interest, and then uses a model to evaluate whether the data support that belief. For example, a researcher might hypothesize that a medication reduces the likelihood of a particular disease and fit a model to test this relationship. If the analysis shows no effect, the hypothesis is not supported. In this context, models are theory-driven and primarily used for inference, that is, understanding whether and how variables are related.

In industry, the primary goal is often different. Rather than focusing on causal relationships, practitioners are typically more concerned with maximizing predictive accuracy. From this perspective, a model created through backward elimination is data-driven rather than theory-driven: variables are retained or removed based on how well they improve prediction, not on whether they align with an existing theoretical framework. As a result, the final model may or may not be interpretable from a theoretical standpoint.",49
1qv95en,6,"it often “works” because the signal is strong enough and the model is used in a stable setting, not because the method is sound. backward elimination breaks down when collinearity, small samples, or reuse for inference matter, so it’s more defensible as a rough heuristic than a principled selection method.",9
1qv95en,7,"I run tree based models and I’ve done forward selection, backward selection, backward eliminate a fixed number of features then forward select, Shapley values, and interactions. With all methods usually the top 3 features are always the same and if you rank the top 10 features from each method they are usually very similar. 

I find backward selection works the best because I have moderate multicollinearity which is a pain to deal with.",4
1qv95en,8,It depends on whether you use it for inference or prediction.,2
1qv95en,9,"Harrell’s critique is mostly about how backward elimination inflates Type I error and gives overly optimistic estimates of effect sizes, especially when the dataset is small or predictors are correlated. That said, in practice, if your dataset is large, signal-to-noise is high, and the goal is purely predictive rather than inferential, it can still produce models that perform well. It’s defensible when you care more about a usable, interpretable set of predictors and have enough data that overfitting is unlikely, but it’s risky if you try to interpret coefficients or generalize beyond the training distribution. context matters more than ideology here.",2
1qv95en,10,"From what I remember Frank’s criticism mostly concerns the inferential aspect of BE and how it affects confidence/p-values of the coefficients. Frank Harrell is very knowledgeable and you should read all of his stuff, but just read w a grain of salt bc he looks down on lots of common practice things in DS that work for other people.",2

Being a one-man band that early in your career is very much not easy. You need to be comfortable teaching yourself things thoroughly enough to produce good work and to be the expert for non-technical stakeholders. But the upside is that it's an opportunity to be very impact and visible. With great responsibility comes great power.

If you go for it, I recommend diving head first into learning time series forecasting, especially the theoretical side of it, and looking for mentors that can support your growth on the programming side (like maybe that MLE).",3
1qv64eu,5,"I had something similar during my data science apprenticeship during my master's degree, minus the ML Engineer.

I was the only person in the department doing data science, and as a result, I had to do four different jobs (data engineer, data ops, data scientist, and data manager).

And when I finally got a permanent position after my apprenticeship at the same place, they added a fifth job: project manager (and mentor at the same time).

After three years, I couldn't take it anymore, having done so many jobs and having worked alone for two years (my colleagues were IAM developers, so we could only talk about IAM, not data or AI). I ended up leaving even though I didn't have a job lined up (I left at the beginning of 2025, so when the market was bad, and yes, it still is, but no big deal, my health was more important).

Given how similar your situation is to mine, you're going to do absolutely every job.

It's up to you whether you want to do them all or not.
On the one hand, it's good for experience and confidence, but on the other hand, don't expect to stay with the company for long.
You'll end up exhausted and will probably never want to do multiple jobs for the same company again, unless it's your own, or you'll only accept it if the pay is good.",3

1qv64eu,7,"In almost the same boat, started at my current Co in another role, did my DS degree alongside that role and now the sole lead/principal level DS and have to do everything without a mentor and it's not just a DS role, it's DE, MLE, MLOps etc. on top of being a DS.  

  
The biggest issue for me is trying to get the traction on DS from non-technical stakeholders, most like the idea of DS etc. but as they don't understand it fully it looses its appeal if you can't show them how it solves their problem, plus everyone is bloody obsessed with GenAI tools since it's all the hype atm but that's a whole other thing to manage expectations over 🤣",2
1qv64eu,8,"being the only ds on a coop can be a mixed bag. u will probably learn a lot fast, but the risk is that there is no one to tell u when an approach is wrong or unrealistic. demand forecasting sounds fine on paper, but in practice the hard part is data quality, assumptions, and explaining uncertainty to non technical people. if the manager is less ml aware and the mle is also new, u might end up owning decisions without real support. for a first coop, that can be stressful, but it can also be valuable if expectations are clearly scoped and they know u are still learning. i would try to clarify how success is defined and how much guidance u will actually get before deciding.",2
1qv64eu,9,"being the only ds with no mentor is risky for a first coop, especially on forecasting where problem framing and validation matter a lot. i’d ask what success looks like for the first 8 to 12 weeks and who actually reviews your work before it’s used in decisions.",1

1qtzq0k,1,"Decades.

If you told me ""company ABC who was founded and built to be ran by an agentic framework"" then maybe I'd say less if they had a very small, specific niche area they focus on. But a company who once had 1000 employess going to 15 people who can mastermind an entire operation just running on prompts and vibes? Decades. 

Not only because the technology to do that will take decades to get there, and not only because the organizational changes that will need to happen will also take decades, but because as work starts getting automated/takes less time to do, what is inevitably going to happen is that those things will become table stakes and companies will want to unlock whatever the next is, whatever differentiates them.

Like, 20 years ago the idea of having a team that focuses on making sure your online ads are the most effective would have sounded like science fiction. Now it's an out of the box functionality that every marketing team has access to. Last time I checked, marketing hasn't died - in fact, they're doing quite well.

But now they're working on microsegmentation, on using AI to develop targeted ads on social media. And once that becomes a fully solved problem that can be enabled with two clicks, someone will already be thinking about what is the next thing to do.

The more repetitive is the job, the more it makes sense to use AI, but for general purpose jobs (and that is every job where you have to interact with a lot of employees to do your tasks) is not anything that is closer for me.",1

I think the one idea people have a hard time rectifying is that the C-Suite/mangers are using AI and are saving themselves time, per numerous industry studies from 2025. But the median developer or data scientist isn't seeing significant gains in leveraging AI and it's a wash. The problem is that none of those median developers get to make meaningful decisions on adoption within their orgs or companies at large. And C-suite's experience is dramatically positive. So we will see rapid adoption of these technologies whether they are useful for the average employee or not because the decisions makers experience has been positive. This rapid adoption will lead to massive training datasets overnight and we will likely see exponential growth in their abilities.

I think if you had to ask me with a lie detector C-Suite would rather ride or die with less developers that are true believers of AI than run a bloated team of all humans and have to explain that capital expenditure to a board when everyone else is getting leaner and more AI focused.

Also I do believe a company primarily driven by agentic AI's will break through and see extreme market success and it will scare everyone off from doing the opposite. Even though it will take hundreds of companies fail and flailing with agentic AI before we get one of those companies, survivor bias at its finest. But a company running well with AI is going to have a massive advantage over a 100% human or even moderate AI use companies.

I also make a habit of not betting against the smartest people and companies. And most people you talk to in the space really do believe what the post describes is within 10 years.

I love the example of automating farming as an analogy for AI coding. We didn't need to build completely robotic human like farmers to automate farming. We built crude metal devices that leveraged the same principles in more efficient and mechanical ways. AI developers don't need to be an exact replica of a human SWE to be a good a good SWE.",-1

1qsxuaa,1,"I’ve been a data scientist for about 5 years and for most of that focused on data cleaning/feature extraction.
From working with teams I think the biggest weakness is an unwillingness to spend time understanding your data set. You have to spend time either building or looking through a data dictionary to understand what each column ought to be. Then you have to look through the data itself and this isn’t just df.describe - especially if you are doing NLP type work you have to actually look at several rows and get a sense of what the data looks like. Spending time doing stuff like this has always helped me immensely, even if it’s just building my own confidence with the data set.

I come from a math background and in writing my earliest paper in undergrad we had to do a lot of grunt work by hand writing out some equations and trying to determine a pattern. My adviser at the time mentioned that this is part of doing the work, you have to get your hands dirty and take a pencil and paper and write it out and stare at it. I honestly think that most data scientists are unwilling to do this, myself included at times. I can’t tell you how many data sets I have inherited and as I am looking through the data I notice rows where an int needs to be a string or vice versa and the data scientist who built the set had no idea. It’s because they don’t actually spend time looking through their own data because it is boring and shitty work. No one wants to test and no one wants to data clean, but to have good models, you need to",10
1qsxuaa,2,">Why is data cleaning hard?

Because humans aren't machines and if your data source requires human input, dirty data is a guarantee.

Secondly, many developers haven't put thought into capturing data when designing a system. Data capturing is more of an afterthought and that leads to data format inconsistency and lack of data validation step at the front end side.

Third, is semantics. Even if a system / human  records clean data, it's still a data professional job to decide on how to consume a data. Does a user spamming clicks on an item counted towards to final CTR metric or we need a rules to ""distinct the intent""?",7
1qsxuaa,3,"I like the framing that cleaning is about getting closer to reality, not aesthetics. I’d add that it feels hard because the definition of “reality” is often implicit and unstable. You only discover the assumptions baked into the data once you try to use it for a concrete decision or model. At that point, you’re negotiating semantics, incentives, and system behavior, not just fixing nulls. that mismatch between analytical intent and how the data was originally produced is usually the real source of pain.",2
1qsxuaa,4,"In my experience data cleaning is hard for 2 reasons. 

1. It’s mostly about making things easier for a computer to work with even when something is plainly obvious for a person. This can make the data professional feel like they’re doing menial task. 

2. Most data professionals think they’re “above” cleaning. This is similar to but not the same as 1.  Many people I’ve worked with think their job is about working out complex calculations, writing scripts, and transforming big data into brilliant insights or $$$. From this mindset, data cleaning is just something that gets in the way of your “real” work.",1
1qsxuaa,5,"i think the hard part is that cleaning is where assumptions get exposed. once u try to map messy logs or human entered fields to something “real,” u realize nobody fully agrees what reality is. in practice it is less about fixing nulls and more about chasing edge cases, silent pipeline failures, and business rules that only live in someone’s head. it also feels never ending because the model keeps finding new problems in the data that no dashboard ever flagged. that gap between system data and how the world actually works is why it never feels done.",1

1qsxuaa,7,"ctrl + a, delete :D Follow me for more tips :D",1
1qsxuaa,8,it's very hard for me : (,1
1qsxuaa,9,"the core issue is that cleaning is always reactive, you discover the mess when you try to use data for something nobody originally planned for. the thing that actually makes a dent is pushing validation closer to the source: column-level contracts, schema tests on ingest, making the producing team own their data quality instead of dumping it on DS to sort out. but that's a people/org problem, not a technical one, which is why it stays painful.",1
1qsls5g,1,"I recommend thinking about whether you enjoy what you are doing. It is ok if you started off heading into data science, but found yourself loving something else. It sounds like you are getting value exposure to driving a business and you shouldn’t discount that just because it wasn’t a part of your original career plan. 

One of my biggest mistakes in my career and holding on too tightly on my career paths. I always wanted to do public policy. I fought for years to remain in public policy even as it didn’t fit the direction life was taking me. Eventually I accepted that data science is what made the most sense for the experiences I was having, the opportunities that I was getting, and the constraints in my life. Once I became open to something other than my original plans, everything made sense and, funny enough, I found a way to contribute to public policy.

So my advice is to hold your career plans with an open hand. If you enjoy what you are doing now and are getting value experience, pour yourself into it. If data science is a deep and persistent passion, as your pour yourself into what you are doing now, you will naturally tackle it in a way that’s unique to someone with a passion in data science and your existing experiences will migrate closer to your career plans. But don’t let your career plans become a ball and chains that limit your ability to get experiences that you didn’t plan on getting or discover passion/talent that you didn’t plan on developing.",27

1qsls5g,3,"this role is drifting away from core data science, even if it is building useful business context. most ds roles still involve a lot of coding, messy data, and model iteration, even at startups. what u are learning now is how decisions get made and how systems get adopted, which is valuable for entrepreneurship, but it does not compound technically. the risk is waking up in a year or two and realizing u cannot pass a hands on ds interview without a lot of catch up. tooling and ops work helps if u pair it with real analysis or modeling on the side. if data is meant to be a core lever in your future business, u probably want deeper reps with data pipelines, analysis, and at least simple models. a good checkpoint is whether u are still growing technically quarter over quarter. if not, it is usually a sign to adjust the role or move.",5
1qsls5g,4,"this doesn’t sound like drifting, it sounds like context building. real ds roles are usually a lot of messy data, stakeholder questions, and glue work, not constant modeling. the risk is staying too long without touching code or stats at all, not doing tooling per se. if entrepreneurship is the goal, seeing how decisions get made and systems break is underrated. just make sure you deliberately keep your technical muscle warm, otherwise the switch back gets harder.,,,",3
1qsls5g,5,"If you're seeing the strategic insights, why not simply build the models in your own time? Why not start building your company in your spare hours and lay the foundation?

1qrtgse,1,"Honestly, the answer is the impact of the decisions. More than one of the models my team and I have built at Amazon have $100s of millions in annual impact, either via top line revenue, company spend, or loss avoidance. Not all of them are incredibly complex (quite often the opposite as they emphasize explainability), but the scientists who do well here are able to understand high value/complex business problems and apply the right solution. I like to think of it like the ship repair problem.

A ship's engine failed, halting production, and no mechanic could fix it. An expert tapped a specific spot with a hammer, instantly repairing it. The $10,000 bill was questioned, prompting the expert to itemize: $1 for tapping, $9,999 for knowing where to tap, highlighting that expertise, not just education and effort, holds immense value.",741
1qrtgse,2,"Well as one of those ICs who currently makes $500k at a FAANG my breakdown is like this:

1. RSUs appreciation over time = $150k
2. Annual RSU refreshers = $100k
3. Base salary and bonus = $300k

I also spent several years working at regular F500 companies before going to FAANG, which counted as valuable experience that allowed me to get hired at a more senior level.

You'll notice that the base comp is indeed much higher in big tech. The reason is mainly that DS here are working on more valuable products and supporting teams of better paid engineers. I'm touching things that involve 10-50x more revenue than what I did at a F500 and I get paid 2.5x more because of it. I'm certainly not 2.5x smarter or harder working than I was back then.",253

From my little observation: you have to develop your own niche, starting from mastering the basics and develop your craft.

Oh, and I detect and underline BS to my stakeholders which is appreciated by my allies, and disliked by those without moat.",30

I guess it’s because they design services that are crucial to those tech co’s the same way SWEs do. The code is the product, so you are not just some cost center. And top tech firms have been paying SWEs lots if you count RSUs for a long time. I guess the question is always have when I run into some incredibly gifted data scientist working for $100k at a small or non tech company is why aren’t they making more. Maybe they hate the rat race in Silicon Valley. Maybe they hate or can’t pass FAANG interviews. But sometimes they just don’t know they could be making 5x as much.",44

I'm talking about writing optimized software for billions, if not millions of concurrent users. Stuff breaks at scale and the architecture of things becomes too complex. Scaling models / APIs to handle 4-5 million+ QPS is a valuable skill that separates them from the F500 Data Scientists at their level.",62
1qrtgse,8,"The data scientists at FAANG are whip smart, have subject matter expertise, and the best ones have product, finance, business, and engineering chops beyond their data science knowledge to be able to put data to good use in large organizations. 

Key example: a good data scientist at a company like Stripe will come with the data science toolkit, but will also have working expertise in finance/accounting, financial engineering, B2B SaaS, or other focus area according to their role. They would be able to make strong recommendations or build models that can work within the business line of the company. 

Tech companies are flat organizationally. It means each data scientist is directly responsible for a scope that the company believes is more valuable than their TC. 

Also, these corporations make tons of money so they can afford to overpay to obtain and retain talent. FAANG companies sell technology products, while this is not true for most F500s. Tech companies lifeblood is directly dependent on their ability to turn data into $$$ while PepsiCo’s lifeblood is to sell more Doritos.",37

I will say the FAANG types often have a sense of over confidence which helps make them seem more competent too. But at the end of the day, they’re not that much different. I know guys doing DS for their local municipalities that have as much skill as people in FAANG.  They just lacked the desire to do high stress interview after high stress interview. Meanwhile the dudes in FAANG just applied everywhere and studied coding problems all day until they landed anything at all that met their requirements. And once their foot was in the door they were made.",11
1qrtgse,10,"About 100k. But for real, it’s usually not just one thing like tech expertise, it’s that they’re really good at a lot of things and fast. Like in my F10 role we’d take our time and have pretty specific scope and just keep on chugging and passing week by week while giving little updates. At FAANG, the question/idea comes up Monday, there’s a team spun up Tuesday with 3 docs for alignment, then 1-2 people powering through deeper analyses than I saw elsewhere Wednesday, a pre-meeting with leads and a few $1B+ scoped org leaders Thursday (who’ve already asked twice that week when you’d be done), then VPs shift teams to focus the laser on your DS recs after an audience Friday, probably netting 5x the yearly salary for the group in the next quarter of execution, while the same cycle starts the next week. All while 2-5 mega projects are ongoing, and metrics reports and ad hoc analyses are being written at all times. TBH, the roles are vastly underpaid at $500k for the value they truly create by aiming the $10M/yr engineering team that drives 6-9x ROI year after year (literally, I calculated this as part of planning: 6x ROI on headcount was the bottom cutoff for “right sizing” the org last year, with mean Eng cost of $950k as the input).

That’s the lowest level DS. The rest crush more. No joke. It’s just not the same scale, and every DS is extraordinarily capable or we just get other ones.

There’s a lot of talk about hiring fresh PhDs by other companies in the comments here and tbh, the hard part is never technical (that’s the minimum cost of entry), it’s doing a job and making the company value and prioritizing work—that’s why companies pay big bucks.",4
1qrohou,1,"From what I have seen, the strategy matters less than being honest about what problem you are actually trying to offload. A lot of teams jump straight to “generate code” and hit the validation wall you describe, because the review cost is real. The places where it seems to work better are narrow, well scoped tasks where correctness is easy to check, like draft documentation, test cases, or refactoring suggestions rather than greenfield logic. On the tooling side, flexibility usually comes from constraining the interface rather than the model. If the inputs and outputs are boring and well defined, the LLM can be sloppy internally without breaking anything. The harder question is whether the team is willing to invest in those interfaces, because that work often looks like overhead rather than leverage at first.",34
1qrohou,2,"LLMs help most when they sit close to very narrow, boring tasks. once u ask them to be creative or own big chunks of logic, review cost explodes. teams that get value usually constrain scope hard, like draft doc outlines, test scaffolds, or simple transforms that already have strong conventions. the cold start issue never really goes away, u slowly build context by fixing outputs and feeding that back. if the model is writing more code than u would, that’s usually a sign the task isn’t well bounded yet. the win is saving time on setup, not replacing judgment.",17
1qrohou,3,"I think LLMs work best as helpers, assistants and never entirely as complete builders. They are good at turning rough notes into short docs and explaining code in simple words or if I put in a more simpler manner just helps you to get started..You want to build a DAG to orchestrate something, want to built agentic frameworks or just to make sense of the data, whatever it is LLM does helps with the cold start problem because context builds little by little

For the validation thing that you pointed it, I think its more the game of prompt engineering in that case…
I have seen multiple cases where validation gets easier when you keep requests small concise and to the point. Ask for one function or one idea, not a full script. Short answers are easier to read and trust. A quick explanation with the code helps catch mistakes fast. As another redditor pointed out, decide on a particular template format you want the LLM input and output to be based upon and it will help you to streamline the use case workflows much better..Lastly, LLM’s efficiency is entirely depended on the context, the inputs you are provided, the sources you are asking it to refer to before it spurts out the responses, hence having a proper data source, data cleaning, document chunking, embeddings , RAG models, evaluation metrics..pondering over all of these goes a long way in unleashing these machine bots in an effective manner",3

Also moved to uv from pipenv. 

Then it’s building some skills for common stuff (like an on call skill that will grab a specified ticket, looks at the Databricks logs, cross check the git history and provide a summary for the on call engineer, and opine if a simple rerun will fix it).

1qqtj9y,1,"And more.  

How do I work with stakeholders to ensure they value the team, so that I can get an appropriate level of funding.  

How do I support and develop each person in my team.  When do I step in, and when do I step back?

The two main mental changes I had were: 

My role is to coach the team, to get everyone performing their best.  Screw the output, if I put my best on a project then I can always do better, but my goal is to maximise team skill, not deliver only top results.  The output is for the IC. 

I’m literally running a small business here.  I’m selling my team. If I want my team to grow then I need more sales.  That means the same as it does in any sales role, listen to your customers and deliver what makes them happy.  

Oh, another thing is that consistency of tools, techniques and approach across your team will make it easier for you to rearrange resources.",28

1qqtj9y,3,"What helped me was realizing that my output stopped being models and started being decisions. A good week was not shipping something myself, but unblocking someone else, killing a low value project early, or reframing a vague request into something the team could actually execute. That felt uncomfortable at first because it is less visible and less concrete.

My sense of judgment got better by sitting closer to stakeholders and paying attention to second order effects. You start noticing which projects quietly create leverage and which ones just generate slides. Saying no became easier once I saw how much opportunity cost there really is. the hardest habit to break was jumping into do the work because I could do it faster. Letting others struggle a bit, while still supporting them, ended up creating way more value long term. It sounds like you are already asking the right questions, which is honestly most of the transition.",7

1qqtj9y,5,"the biggest shift for me was realizing my output stopped being models or analyses and became decisions and constraints. a lot of value judgment came from seeing where teams kept getting stuck and asking why. often it wasn’t lack of skill, it was unclear goals or work that never connected back to an outcome. deciding what not to work on got easier once i forced every project to answer what changes if this succeeds. if the answer was vague, it usually wasn’t worth the time. leverage through others came from setting direction clearly and then getting out of the way, even if they solved it differently than i would have. letting go of being the fastest or most correct person took time, but that’s where scale actually shows up.",5
1qqtj9y,6,"A Team Lead is typically a player/coach role, where you align the team towards a common goal, ensure that maps to overall organizational KPIs, assign work/projects against the skills and development goals of the ICs, ensure they have access to training and resources, etc. In short, you help lead the way, but show the way with a 70/30 split across the ‘playing’ and ‘coaching’.

You should make sure you push your manager to get you the overall goals, KPIs and strategy of the organization so you can translate that down to your team. And this position should come with more responsibility around what to do and why you do it. 

Also, I would expect this position to have more cross-company visibility and influence. So, if that’s not happening then talk to your manager about getting into meetings where decisions are being made.

Hope that helps.",2
1qqtj9y,7,"Lots of good wisdom in already in this thread but I'll add my two cents on how to get work done through other people rather than doing in yourself. I read once in a management book (I think it was ""the making of a manager"") that your job as a team lead is to 1) define a goal, 2) help your team understand if they are moving towards that goal, and 3) inspire them to care about that goal. In my experience, that second role - helping people understand if they're moving towards a goal - is the most important part but it's also easiest to overlook. It can be tough in data work to understand if you're making progress or if you're getting stuck in a rabbit hole. Your instincts on how to zig and zag through various small decisions are likely great, which is why you got promoted, and now your job is to imprint upon your intuitions and tastes on your team so that they can start to make those same micro-decisions. So its important to both checkin frequently to help make those decisions, as well as explain your reasoning (e.g. ""we want to display the data in this way because our stakeholders are particularly interested in understanding this dimension of the data"" versus ""use a bar chart because its cleaner""). 

  
Relatedly, the best tactical management advice I ever got was ""don't only taste the soup when it's done."" The worst thing you can do as a team lead is assign a task that takes weeks and only review it when it's done. By contrast, great head chefs will check in along the way to see how their chefs are prepping the ingredients, they will take an early taste of the stock, give adjustments, etc. That can sometimes be hard for younger ICs since they might believe that they should only show you finished products or only checkin when they've made great progress. So you'll need to encourage checkins when they're stuck and help them feel comfortable being vulnerable when something is not going well.",2
1qqtj9y,8,"Just to clarify, do you have direct reports? Or are you the tech lead, responsible for technical direction, strategy, etc. without the people management piece?",1
1qqtj9y,9,"Nothing actually changes except maybe you get to say no a bit more to people outside the team.

I find your language really strange. It sounds like it's coming from management books. Just keep doing your normal job and try to help the less experienced people not drown in the bullshit. I don't see how you even get to be a team lead if you weren't already involved in planning, project selection, coaching juniors, etc.

I've finished Applied Computer Science BEng and I'm currently working as a Python Developer Working Student (gonna stick for that role for \~2 years, since that's kinda the company's way of working). 

I'm not that big of a fan of LLM's and ""corporate"" DS that's there just to generate more money, would love to work within Game Dev or Simulation Models for Ecology / Medicine / Smart Cities, e.g. would love to work with AI Driven traffic lights system (though my city seems pretty against the idea dealing with traffic xd).

What are your guys opinions on that? Does that even matter for a future employer?

Here's a quick recap of a couple of courses I'd take in each of the careers:  
AI: Fundamentals of Optimization, Complex Networks, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Deep Neural Networks, Data Processing and Knowledge Discovery, Metaheuristics, NLP, Recommender Systems, Application of Fuzzy Techniques, Big Data Processing

AM: Partial Differential Equations, Simulation of Stochastic Processes, Optimization Theory, Applied Functional Analysis, ML for Data Analysis, Unstructured Data Analysis, Advanced Topics in Dynamic Games, RL in Multi-Agent Systems, Estimation Theory",1

Quick coding-specific question for anyone who interviewed recently: Was the coding list/DSA-heavy (e.g., things like palindromes, 3Sum, two pointers, etc.) or was it mostly data work (pandas/dplyr, joins/merges, groupby/aggregations, cleaning, basic modeling / A/B metrics)?

Also helpful (high-level is fine): How strict was syntax vs logic (since code may not be run)? Were common libraries (pandas/numpy or dplyr) assumed/allowed?",1

I am currently a student in migration studies (BA and currently writing the thesis for the MA). Throughout these studies I have been able to discover different statistical methods of analysis and I have tried to focused on that whenever I had the opportunity. Turns out I really like working with stats and big datasets from formulating a research question to providing clear and comprehensible results with good visualizations. During this MA I have also done an internship at the department of the university where I basically was the 'stats guy' and did a bunch of stuff with a fresh new database and helped every researchers who were working with it. I will also use stats for my thesis. I will do a second MA next year (if I get admitted 🤞) that is much more focused on economy and includes more stats focused courses, nottably econometrics.

With all of this background I would really like to find a job as a data analyst or anything related to data gathering/vizualization/ risk analysis, etc.. I was wondering if you think that my profile is something common in this job market? From what I have seen online and what information I got from my network, data analysts are needed but many job posts seem to search for profiles in computer science which is not really where I come from. (Btw I live in Scandinavia and can speak French, english and hopefully a nordic language soon)

1qn6qhu,6,"No questions myself but wanted to open myself to questions for folks who are looking to transition into the field or grow their DS career. I’m a staff-level data scientist at a hyperscaler in SF that you have heard of. I’ve been in the field for 6 years now. I come from a non-conventional background (before DS I worked in various roles across warehouse ops for an ecommerce startup, management consulting, and finance). 

[please don’t message me for a referral - I typically only refer folks I can vouch for personally 🙏]


- EQ > IQ. DS is a field that attracts a lot of smart, quiet introverts. Working on sociability, networking, and “putting yourself out there” returns far higher dividends than polishing your resume or gaining more and more tech skills. It may surprise you but speaking to folks at conferences, parties, or worst case LinkedIn messaging your school alumni can open lots of unexpected doors. 
- The same is true on the job. Surprise: people like working with those they like to be around. Landing impact and doing well in your data science role is 75% stakeholder management and 25% actually coding. The most successful DSes aren’t those with the best code, they’re those who can run the business. 
- Data science isn’t an entry level job. An entry level data scientist typically has at least a few years work experience in an adjacent role. I see a lot of folks coming from economic consulting, analytics, product management, and academia. The reason for this is that domain knowledge and business acumen are necessary to translate your technical work into a business result.
- Breaking into data science can be somewhat random. My best advice for those not in the industry is to look for opportunities to use data science methods to improve processes or change the business wherever you currently work. I landed my first data science role because I started applying data science methods to inventory management, then moved on to support our ads team, and eventually got a new “analytics” job title. That cracked the door open for me to enter data science.",11

- engineering, make your stuff work at scale

Startups can compress these roles, but rigor often gets traded for speed, so you end up learning workarounds more than good systems. the question I always ask is whether the model actually ships and stays alive six months later.

1qhiw2d,1,"Computational neuroscience PhD who hires for DS roles weighing in. Structured data-science programs are not necessarily superior (and in many ways can be *inferior*) to highly quantitative STEM fields in terms of DS skills. Often it's up to the student to steer their experience in the lab toward computational approaches, big-data analytics, etc. If you're on a microbiology PhD track, you'll likely find yourself doing data collection, statistical analyses, problem solving, project management, etc. at a high level as a threshold of satisfying your course requirements, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and defending your dissertation. What will set you apart if you want to be a DS *outside* the normal industries into which microbio PhDs tend to gravitate is your ability to link those skills to the business cases that your target industry cares about.

I would **not care** if you finished some micro-certification on Data Camp or similar. That's pure noise, IMHO. As a STEM PhD I would want to read your publications and discuss your methods in the context of my industry.",22
1qhiw2d,2,"I left a PhD program (math, and in particular NOT statistics) to become a data scientist. I credit every job I've gotten to having relevant personal projects I could talk intelligently about in interviews.

From the other side of the zoom call, you're never going to find someone with all the skills you want when hiring for an entry or mid level role, so you don't really expect to. This is especially true when it comes to cloud tech, since that's so provider-specific. It just doesn't make sense to learn GCP, AWS and Azure before you have a job that needs one of them. What you're looking for when hiring is someone you think could learn what they need to know for the role.",25
1qhiw2d,3,"I have a terribly non-standard background and I am a Senior DS and have worked in consulting, international banking, healthcare, FAANG, and more, all as a DS. I've been working specifically as a DS since 2015 but was working as a ""biometrician"" at a boutique environmental stats firm before that.

Everything beyond my MS was in research, field work, and writing technical papers for peer review in fish and wildlife. I was an R expert (and still am, kinda) and although was not ""officially"" a statistician, I had a *very* deep background in mathematical modeling and frequentist stats. When I made the conscious decision to jump to ""industry"" instead of doing environmental work, I had the basics of SQL in my back pocket, thanks to having done a ton of data management at my boutique environmental firm.

**What got me hired first was not the skillz but more how I approached a problem.** Bringing a different skill set to an organization is often times EXACTLY what a hiring manager wants, particularly if they get the signal that you're smart and can learn quickly. This is really all that matters: be smart and learn quickly and be able to show that you are or can do both. 

Be able to talk about models you know and how you could apply them. (For example, I applied nesting site fidelity models from sage grouse populations to predicting whether or new patients would return to a specific hospital. Same problem, different data and biz questions.) Be able to talk about how you apply stats. Be able to show how you write functions and think about how a model you've built locally could be handled by DevOps (or yourself) and moved into prod in \[insert cloud provider of choice\].

Although Python is pretty much the currency of DS these days, there are still some R shops around and there are some good hiring managers left who are toolset agnostic, so long as the work is good and can be productionized. Python is easier to productionize and if you're already an R person, is pretty easy to pick up. Syntax differences can be funky, but aren't insurmountable.

A PhD already helps a lot there, especially if you can frame your research work in terms of data cleaning, assumptions, tradeoffs, and decision making. Structured tracks are fine to fill gaps, but nobody I know checks whether someone completed an entire ladder. One or two solid projects where you show end to end thinking, SQL pulls, Python analysis, and a clear takeaway matter way more.

You could also take classes in statistics, etc. It's typically covered by the tuition remission. unless you are in some shitty program.

You learn failure modes deeply, but you rarely get credit for creating new methods. The customer project path is usually better if you can negotiate real ownership of algorithm pieces instead of pure integration.

Also ask explicitly how people on each path have moved into algorithm roles before. That answer tells you a lot.",3

* write postmortems on failures (root cause + mitigation)
* turn recurring issues into robust tests
* propose measurable improvements (latency, accuracy, edge-case handling)

But you also need time to actually build/ship things. I’d personally do a hybrid approach:

* keep the role that gives you exposure to hard edge cases
* build one side project where you own the full pipeline end-to-end (even a small one)

That combination = real-world debugging + actual algorithm building = strong MLE profile.",1
1qh0m1y,7,if your goal is AI or algorithm design focus on which path gives you influence over problem framing and evaluation not just tasks. support work helps only if you are learning failure modes and shaping metrics otherwise it becomes reactive tuning. integration work helps only if you can question specs and validate whether the system actually works in the real world. i would push your manager for ownership of error analysis metric definition or design reviews because that is where algorithm designers are really developed.,1
1qh0m1y,8,"If your end goal is AI/ML and algorithm design, I would bias toward the path that keeps you closest to building and modifying systems, even if it is not perfect. Deep support work teaches you how algorithms fail in the real world, which is valuable, but it can trap you in reactive mode with little room to design new things. Integration work at least keeps you writing code and understanding system boundaries, which is easier to evolve into ownership of algorithms later.

That said, the ideal move is usually not choosing one extreme. I would push your manager for explicit time or scope around algorithm ownership, even small pieces, validation logic, prototypes, or improvements rather than just glue work. Career stagnation tends to happen when your role stops producing artifacts that look like design or code. Debugging builds intuition, but building things is what usually gets you labeled as an algorithm engineer.",1
1qh0m1y,9,"If the goal is real AI or algorithm design, I would bias toward whichever path gets you closest to owning a problem end to end, even if the work feels less glamorous. Deep support work teaches you how and why algorithms fail in the wild, which is valuable, but it can stall if you never get to change the design that caused the failure. Pure integration has the opposite risk, you ship a lot but rarely make core decisions.

In practice, the people I see move into stronger ML or algorithm roles are the ones who combine failure analysis with proposing and implementing fixes. I would push your manager for a hybrid scope where you debug edge cases and then actually redesign or prototype changes, not just tune knobs or write reports. Titles matter less than whether you can point to concrete algorithmic decisions you made and systems you improved because of real-world behavior.",0

I am getting my MS in applied data analytics (graduation May 2026) and am struggling to even get interviews at this point.

Teams that treat MLE as research plus glue care less about this, while platform or product-facing teams care a lot.

All of these models are pre-trained and you can do RAG-like stuff. You just pass them the docs (or set up an OCR front end to do so first) and explain what you want.

I would evaluate options based on how transparent the retrieval is, how much control you have over chunking and metadata filters, and how predictable the outputs are under edge cases.

If it looks like unpaid consulting or has unclear evaluation criteria, that is usually a signal about how the team treats candidates and, often, employees.

Testing for domain knowledge specifics means they are targeting for a certain type of DS that you wouldn’t fit anyway without experience in the industry.

At 4.5 years of experience, you’re in the mid-level range (Senior is 6 years of experience). I’d recommend the following steps:

- Identify your target domain. Your target domain could be a science domain like recsys or dynamic pricing. It could also be a business domain like marketing or operations

- Do one project (not more than one) that tackles a common problem in your target domain. Build a good GitHub repo for this project and use the readme section to explain this project in detail using the STAR format. Your hiring managers may not read your GitHub before the interview, but doing this will give you sufficient knowledge to explain this project in the interview when assessed for science depth

- Decide whether you want to be DS or MLE/AS. If you want to be MLE/AS, do Leetcode and be comfortable with it. Also, practice ML design",5

Think of domain like learning traffic rules in a new country. You already know how to drive. You just need a short adjustment period, not a new license.

Defense to private sector is less about relearning math and more about adapting to different incentives, timelines, and risk tolerance.

1qbhvqw,7,It’s fake job postings to feed the narrative that there’s a “Labor shortage”. It’s fuel so that these companies can continue to increase H1B hiring and offshore,8
1qbhvqw,8,"There's an easy fix to this. Require any posted position to post up a bond that is a percentage of the mean total compensation (including stock award and fringe benefits) of the company.  It doesn't need to be disruptive or be a lot, just something that adds a cost to wasting people's time. You could make it 0.1% of that total comp. Or maybe that's not enough and it needs to be more. I have no idea the exact number, but a study can figure out at what point it's adding friction with no benefit and where it's got the most utility to discourage bad actors enough for them to stop. Continuing my analogy, basically make them post up the equivalent of what they'd pay for something like 2 hours of compensation of their average employee. They're going to occupy the attention and time of literally hundreds of hours of other people's unpaid time that will be applying for that job anyway, so as a fraction of the real cost this has on society it's peanuts.

If they fill the position, great, when they submit their new employee's first IRS withholding, they are allowed to submit that payment minus the bond they posted for the employee's position. The company gets their money back in full, effectively making it cost nothing in monetary terms to search for and hire the person.

If they don't fill the position, that sucks, but Dept of Labor keeps the bond. Company pays a financial cost, which makes them think next time about how they market the position and who they're targeting to apply for it, and hopefully they'll be better next time and not create a time-waster for otherwise qualified individuals that are being baited by a company that is using AI to post and repost the same position every day so that at any given time they'll have 50 qualified candidates that they can hire and onboard at a moment' notice. This kind of thing generates value for some companies by converting other people's wasted time into a way to quickly have a pool of candidates ready to go at any moment, instead of spending real resources into doing a search for a real position that will be filled. For companies that are generating, posting, and then taking the job postings down automatically with software tools that don't cost any of their own human time, they are wasting the human time and energy of people in society that aren't being compensated. The value of convenience they're getting for (essentially) free is paid for by wasting other people's time, so a forfeited job posting bond is the relatively tiny cost that is borne on them for having the right to waste this much human capital and human energy.

The money is only deducted from the first IRS withholding payment. This forces a compliance with actually hiring someone, since they're creating a transfer payment from the company to a taxpayer and therefore generating federal income taxes and payroll taxes.

If they want to keep paying the fee to have this convenience, that's fine, but every time it incurs a new fee. I don't care what fund the fee gets added to since it's a disincentive from participating in this anti-social manipulative and time-wasting behavior for people chasing an invisible carrot. But maybe you could use the money to fund career development services for the public.

I'm sure you can figure out some loopholes in that basic concept, as I came up with this plan in 1 minute. But I'm confident you can run something like this without making it onerous on the company that is hiring and give them an economic incentive for only using applicants time when they are actually serious about hiring. Could possibly use median total comp instead of mean, but I chose mean because it captures the weight of the salaries of senior leadership to prevent a possible loophole where chief officers are payed 100 million a year compensation while the median employee makes $10 an hour where their entire shell company's job is farming applicants for positions that pay $150 an hour. We get rid of all loopholes like this to make companies pay a real tangible cost for wasting time and things would be much better for everyone.",23

I'm looking to do something related to healthcare. How would you suggest I spend my time in the next 12 months? The school I work at has a MS in health data analytics and AI as well as an MPH program with a focus on data analytics. Would these be worth it or should I just get proficient in the commonly used python libraries and SQL and build a portfolio? Thanks for any help.",2

1qalzjc,3,"Hi everyone! I’m a Geoscientist with a background in hydraulic fracturing operations. I’m currently transitioning into Data Science and I’m eager to apply my analytical skills to both geological and broader business challenges.

I'm looking for community insights on a few points:

* **Model Focus:** Given my background in O&G, which models or techniques should I master first? (e.g., Time-Series, Spatial Data, or Predictive Maintenance?)
* **Career Path:** Is it realistic to jump into freelance work, or should I secure a corporate role first to build a solid foundation?
* **Community:** Any recommendations for groups or forums for STEM professionals pivoting to DS? 

Looking forward to your advice! :)",1

1qalzjc,5,"I am trying to enter into data science, interested in going to health science domain. Prev experience was frontend web development.
Started reading ISLP.
Want to get my hands dirty with mathematics, stats.

Any suggestions for next steps to take?",1
1q85xuw,1,"About a year ago I was doing Cursor with Jupyter Notebooks, now I'm all Claude code. Instead of doing Jupyter Notebooks, and I just make a folder/project and have Claude code set up the pipelines, feature engineering, and modeling with python scripts.

It's so much faster than my old workflow which could take a week. Now it takes half a day at most. 

The tools have also just gotten way better. I remember before I had a lot of issues with hallucinations with Cursor + Sonnet 3.5 and doing weird things with my PyTorch models but I rarely get that now with Claude Code + Sonnet 4.5

I do check everything often. Sometimes I'll have a script to test things or create a plot and check that everything looks sensible. Sometimes I will review the code directly. ",42
1q85xuw,2,"Personally, I don't use AI to code at all to be honest.

I like to read docs and error messages (when they are good) lol, but people on my team usually just ask standard ChatGPT for some sketch of what the code for some task would look like and iterate from there.

In my current and my previous company I haven't met anyone who would go full-on AI IDE vibe coding style.

We usually all worked from the terminal / IDEs with AI features disabled. In my experience, people don't want to leave their current workflow to try some new things.

Once you know your language's API well enough, AI tool feel ""unnecessary""? If I start using Python instead of R for my job, I would do the same ChatGPT approach, but working in R for the past 7 years I know the API well enough to not need it.",42
1q85xuw,3,"What changed for me is caring less about the specific tools and more about where they sit in the loop. A lot of the gains come from collapsing context switching rather than from any single model or editor. Once code, experiments, and notes live close together, iteration speeds up even if the underlying tech is similar.

I am also more skeptical of raw productivity multipliers. Most of the real wins show up in exploratory phases, not in the last mile where correctness and debugging dominate. The stack matters, but only insofar as it reduces friction when you are testing ideas. Past that point, the bottleneck tends to move back to problem formulation and evaluation, which no tool really fixes.",7
1q85xuw,4,im seeing less convergence on a single stack and more convergence on patterns. most teams i talk to still code in notebooks or lightweight app frameworks but the real shift is AI being embedded as a co-worker for refactoring exploration and documentation rather than a magic answer box. the biggest productivity gains usually come once people standardize prompts evaluation checks and repo conventions so the assistant behaves predictably across projects. tool choice matters but workflow discipline and shared patterns seem to matter more than which model or editor you use.,5
1q85xuw,5,"Agreed that productivity has skyrocketed. Frankly, our team is now down to 2-3 people and we've been asked to do the work of what used to be an entire 3rd party company (that no longer exists) of roughly 20 people. So yup AI replaced an entire company with only 3 people.  We use a combination of ChatGPT and Claude. Combine that with VSCode, RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, a lot of AWS infrastructure and we have all the tools to run our data science team.",30
1q85xuw,6,"I have been using claude code for developing packages and webapp. For data related tasks like eda, cleaning, I like to use an extension called Jovyan because it suits my notebook workflow",3
1q85xuw,7,Super interesting workflow! I’m curious about the transition to Marimo—what was the biggest pain point with Jupyter that made you switch?,3

1q85xuw,10,"I almost exclusively work with Gemini. Not a DS yet, but currently in my undergrad years and serving as RA. The project requires a real ton of Python.  
My problem is that I can (and love to) brainstorm and form the math foundation for the current project, but coding isn't really my taste up to now. I often spent days working out the right math that makes a plausible DL model, consulted with the PI, and let Gemini do the code for me.

Pre-model data engineering and model workings is all math so I handle that reasonably. The model is coded by Gemini and I check it frequently for updates. This is basically what went through 2025 and is still going now.  
Actually for now I think I'd better start to use Gemini to teach myself how to code an entire model from scratch, rather than let it write the full script.",2

1q6k1xl,8,"BS. 

Would like to see the methodology used to arrive at the number. First, due diligence, e.g. how are duplicate postings or reposted jobs handled. Second, ar difference between job ads and actual hires. Likely, some AI based fake jobs published just to send a message. Likely, those actually hired don't match job description, especially in this area. 

There is metric shitton of tech in this world: hardware, embedded systems, controllers, security systems, databases, etc etc. 53% of all these people are now building LLMs?? More likely, people have given up on advertising actual jobs on LinkedIn",3

1q64yb5,1,"This matches a pain point I keep running into with agentic systems. Once the logic gets even mildly complex, unconstrained agents feel brittle and hard to debug because everything is entangled. The graph based framing makes it much easier to reason about failure modes and to fix one step without breaking five others. I also like the idea of letting a more freeform agent live inside a bounded node when you actually want exploration. Curious how you handle versioning and testing of the graph itself as it grows, since that seems like the next maintainability cliff.",1

1q64yb5,3,"This is spot on - I have been thinking about this problem for several weeks, and my working mental model is that 'constrained agents' are actually more human-like in their execution than AI-only agents:

* Repetitive / predictable tasks are aligned to our 'System 1' thinking; the unpredictability of LLMs makes them a poor fit for tasks that could be automated with RPA (not to mention token cost) 
* On the other hand, RPA breaks when things change, are dynamic, or require 'System 2' problem solving. This is were LLMs can fill a critical gap; the outcomes are less predictable, but with sufficient experience / context, they can be quite good
