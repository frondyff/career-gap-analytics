1qwrtk9,2,"Yes the pivot is absolutely feasible and you are much closer than you think. Your economics background and market intelligence experience already align well with analytics, and many people enter MSBA programs with little to no programming and catch up quickly if they put in the work early. It will be fast paced and uncomfortable at first, but most programs are designed for people like you and focus on applied skills rather than hardcore computer science. 

Consulting firms do value an MS degree especially when it clearly upgrades your skill set, and media entertainment and TMT are very realistic targets since your domain knowledge will differentiate you from more generic analytics grads.",1
1qwrtk9,3,"I also have an economics undergraduate degree. Did less analytical work than you in my professional career. 6 years into corp life, (age 29), I transitioned to analytics.

1qwpoxu,2,"This mostly comes down to how technical you want to go and what kind of roles you’re targeting. An MSBA is usually more business focused, with lighter math and programming, and it’s perfectly sufficient for roles like business analyst, BI analyst, or analytics roles embedded in marketing, ops, or finance. 

An MS in Data Analytics or Data Science tends to go deeper into statistics, programming, and modeling, which opens more technical roles but can be tougher without a strong technical background. If your goal is applied analytics and decision support rather than building models, an MSBA is often the better and safer choice.",1

1qwpbqq,2,"This really resonates. I’m still interviewing right now, and this has been one of the hardest adjustments for me too. I kept grinding SQL and stats, but then drew a blank when the interviewer asked follow-up questions.

Your advice really helped, and I figured I could integrate it into a structure I already implement during my mock interviews, which is to explain my assumptions out loud and talk about trade-offs even if they’re not explicitly asked. Practicing with more realistic, interview-style questions also made a bigger difference than just doing more problems. I made sure to look for questions that were tailored to the role/company I was applying for.",12
1qwpbqq,3,I think what you’ve said is true. Now with some significant on the hiring I’ve seen a lot of common themes on how people mess up interviewing in analytics. The most common error I see (and I’ve certainly done this myself in the past) is not having a structured approach while answering every question. This could be a strict framework like STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) or it could be just a narrative approach with a beginning middle and end. But every substantial question should be answered with some sort of structure. I’d say the majority of analytics people I interview take a grab bag approach to answers where they’re just rattling off ideas or metrics and for me that’s always an instant decline. ,4
1qwpbqq,4,"One big thing that a lot of folks miss during interviews is that the interviewers don't just care about you getting the correct answer; they want to understand your thought process, how you approach and solve problems, why you made decisions, etc. It might not feel natural at first, but once you get comfortable answering questions that way, you'll likely go farther in interviews.

And this is stuff that is going to come up once you get the job. Because your work isn't always very straightforward. You'll have to get comfortable thinking critically and scoping out solutions and explaining your results as well as your decisions. Not just to your boss but to your business partners and possibly executives. So they are also testing if you'll fall apart when that time comes.",1
1qwpbqq,5,"Mean take:

If you cannot connect your effort to business outcomes and/or the risks of erroneous data and the impacts to business decisions and/or….

Then you’re a monkey to be replaced by AI 

Sadly, this is my key take away when interviewing people for analytics roles.",-1

1qwgs7n,2,"There's not really an answer that's going to be broadly applicable. But to start, who is typically making these requests and what are their roles? 


I've run an analytics team and a broader performance marketing team at a large bank and when the requests were coming outside of the department the solution was ""how to we establish clear processes, expectations on our obligations outside of the department, and intake/request forms"" - do you need to discuss with your manager about how your time is being used in a way that may not aligned with what they want. When the requests were coming from the person I reported to, it involved me pushing for them to communicate priority so we could triage. When the requests came from the C-suite it was often, screw it, I guess we're dropping everything, if this keeps up we will need more people. 


So that is to say, the solution may be processed-based, involved talking to management, and/or political/cultural. Or there may be no solution at that company and you'll get swept up in whatever is ""super important"" right then and  later you'll be criticized for being reactionary and not strategic and replaced by an AI solution someone convinces them can fill the tactical role they pushed you into. ",12
1qwgs7n,3,"Use a ticket/request system (Jira, Aha, etc). That would help identify some sort of ranking/priority order, so long as you continuously emphasize the need for people to use it. 

Plus, this kind of system tends to actually cut down on ad hoc requests, as people who are 'just curious' but don't really need specific info, won't bother with it.",8
1qwgs7n,4,"I walk over to their desk, and show them how to find the number they want. Then they stop asking me for it. ",5
1qwgs7n,5,">when they’re testing hypotheses.

Are you running experiments in real time? Or is this more like ""Can you tell me when metric A went up if metric B also went up?""?

Can you create a Slack bot that can answer the latter questions where you use an LLM trained to generate SQL queries?",4
1qwgs7n,6,"I set up a teams channel for ad-hoc requests. In the form the priority is listed as being an option of 3 days (urgent), 7 days (high), 14 days (low)

Note that there is no 1 day option. If my sprint is full and I actually can't do it, I'll ask someone to lower their prio and it hasn't happened so far that they deny. If it somehow does happen, escalate to your manager and get them to ask/reprioritize your sprint.

This is honestly an extension of the age-old work question ""how do I say no"". Most people don't realize this, but you can simply say no to anything you want, and as long as you communicate it early enough, no one cares.

Also you can do some cool things with the form like link to the dashboard, get an llm to answer, etc.",2
1qwgs7n,7,"Start telling people it will take twice as long as it will usually take to deliver it.

This will trigger one of two consequences:

1. They'll stop asking and figure it out themselves.

2. They'll complain to someone in management.  Whoever from management comes to talk to you about it is the person *all* of these requests should be going to instead of you so *they* can decide how you are to be resourced out.  Then get this person to tell the requestors it will take twice as long as it will usually take.

If neither of the above occurs, start shopping around for another job.  No, I'm not kidding.",2
1qwgs7n,8,"You need to establish a system. Forms are good because a little friction encourages people to look up their own numbers and also think through their requests. Workg in sprints helps too so you’re not constantly reprioritizing. I’d recommend:

\- Start working in sprints. Ideally pick the same sprint cycle as another team and match theirs 

\- Set up an intake form. Ideally this would link to Asana, Jira, or some other tools you have that creates tickets, but worst case it could just be a Microsoft/Google form. 

\- Tell everyone “thanks for your request. Please fill in this form so I can prioritize it alongside requests from others. The next sprint starts on X so at that time I will prioritize all requests and let you know when I can get to this”. 

\- Occasional things can still be handed immediately but it becomes the exception, not the rule. 

You’ll get push back at the start but people will get used to it. ",2
1qwgs7n,9,"Sounds like you either need to find a way to prioritize requests with a ticketing system, automate your answers, or create dashboards and refer your colleagues to these dashboards.

For example, if people keep asking about churn and you can, you could make a dashboard and instead of telling them ""we lost 10 clients last month"", you share the link to the dash and tell them to look for themselves.",2
1qwgs7n,10,"If what they are asking for already exists, I provide a link to it and point out where the answer is.

On a past team, I scheduled a recurring ""open office hour"" every week, sent an invite to everyone's calendars, and told them that is when they can drop in for hands-on assistance like this. Then when they'd Slack me throughout the week with these questions, I'd remind them to come to my office hour. If they couldn't make it, I told them to schedule 15 minutes on my calendar so I could walk them through it. 

If you get a lot of questions about tests/experiments, schedule a weekly or bi-weekly Peer Review for them to share their test plans, including forming hypotheses, selecting metrics, etc. You can be a reviewer, but they can also review each other. 

Outside of that, before agreeing to do any task, always ask ""what are you going to do with this information?"" or ""what decision are you trying to make?"" - If they can't articulate a reason, then I don't proceed. ""I'm curious"" is not a good reason. 

If your company already has a ticketing system for other teams, you can use that for all requests and have your intake form include the questions above. Often, the work of writing the ticket reduces the number of ad hoc asks.

Also, manage expectations and timelines. ""Based on the scope of this request and what else I am working on, I can get you an answer in X \[days/weeks\]."" If they push for sooner, then reply ""you'll need to check with \[other person\] if I can deprioritize \[other project\] in order to work on your request.""",2

1qvrqmn,3,"I don’t think “centralize everything” is the fix. The pain usually comes from 1) no shared IDs/definitions and 2) no owner for the metric layer, so every team rebuilds the same logic slightly differently.



A pattern that works is hub-and-spoke: centralize only the boring foundational stuff (customer/account/product, event schema, core finance) + a metric dictionary, then let domains publish curated marts with contracts and tests. You get consistency without forcing every dataset into one monolith.



If the numbers disagree today, I’d start by picking 5–10 exec metrics, write down the exact grain/filters, and add automated reconciliation checks between the two sources. That’s usually what rebuilds trust.

We are now back to testing and have seen some promising results when we keep adding more and more context to an LLM. Things like relationships between data, descriptions, common SQL patterns, business logic etc.

Not close to perfect, but we keep being surprised by how much we can improve the results by adding context that we currently keep in a .yml file and then have some different steps from a user types a question to an answer is created. F.ex we have a step which just tries to interpret a question to a domain, then a SQL creator, then an analyzer and then a step to dig deeper into our data depending on this first result to try to provide our users with more than just an initial answer.

Note, we already have a data platform in place, we do not start from scratch. But where we before maybe duplicated data to specific new tables or views catered to a  business need we now try to add context and see what an LLM is able to do.

So we will keep experimenting, and test in small scale. We think this is the best way to follow along and see how far we can get.",1

I'm not running any of the fun models or forecasts on my own.",6
1qvlnil,4,"Does any of the data you need live in a database like Snowflake or Big Query or AWS? SQL is how you extract it.

1qvlnil,5,"I am a marketer and use SQL for all of my analysis since my data lives in a database. If I needed to I could probably survive with Excel

Python can be helpful in marketing experiments for calculating incrementality with confidence intervals, power analysis, and post-hoc segmentation. You can use it to create descriptive and predictive models to find the right guest at the right time for your campaign. An uplift model is great for this. Another common use is MMM models",2
1qvlnil,6,"Beyond just ""learning SQL"", the real evolution is shifting from marketing UIs toward a personalized data environment tailored to specific needs. I recently have been using n8n to build out mini workflows to input raw data into a local db. The real helpful part is using n8n nodes like mini codes and llm's to automate the analysis and cleaning. 

One thing that also helped is leveraging a coding agent like claude or cursor to help create an agentic layer over this stack. It can deploy quick python or sql queries for data cleaning or even UI's to visualize particular data. I no longer ""check"" reports; I deploy python scripts to monitor for anomalies and automate attribution.",2
1qvlnil,7,"From what I have seen, Python and SQL tend to live just outside the core marketing tools, not instead of them. GA and Sheets are great for answering known questions. SQL usually shows up when you need to join messy sources, define your own metrics, or trust the numbers enough to make tradeoffs. Python comes in when the question is repeatable or annoying enough that you do not want to keep doing it by hand.

The biggest gains are usually around stitching context together. Pulling raw events, CRM data, and campaign metadata into one place so you can see sequences, drop offs, or lag effects that dashboards flatten away. That is also where automation helps, like weekly anomaly checks, segmentation refreshes, or cleaning data before it ever hits a report.

Overengineering usually happens when people chase novelty. The useful work is boring. Reduce manual prep, make assumptions explicit in code, and answer questions you could not reliably answer in GA alone. If it saves thinking time or reduces argument over numbers, it is probably worth it.",1

Unless you're at the top of your game, nobody is likely to hire you JUST for data analytics but rather for knowledge of the content you're studying and the capacity for data analytics.

For example, they would take someone who understands buyer habits from marketing that learnt data skills over someone with really great data skills but learning the market over time.

The really stake in the heart is how this means the field is going to be WAY worse for neurodiverse and introverted people because more and more of the role will be about being an active participant in the team.

I was lucky to get hired as a data analyst straight after graduation. I was panning on doing a 2nd bachelors on economics but since I did land a job in analytics (I am stat major) I dropped out.

Today I am data engineer, Data analyst, AI developer all in one body. I sit in meetings designing how to track a campaign results, I am building infrastructure by connecting various data sources into our data lake, answering easy questions from shareholders as well as building simple dashboards to give our logistic personnel motivation to get on top of the leaderboard etc etc. 

However, following and reading about how AI is evolving and how it looks on bigger companies makes me question whether all this work is going to be done be AI soon. I therefore think about leaving this job and focus on the economics degree again, and then use my data knowledge to exceed in my role.

Do you think AI will end such roles as I have - ”one data person” that handles all data related stuff in a company, or will this become the new ”data analyst” - still someone who handles all the data, but this time centered around one person instead of a team.

They track loyal return frequency, direct traffic depth, and subscription or email engagement instead of raw sessions.

For example, a system that inspects data shape, size, and transformations, then routes workloads between pandas, Polars, or DuckDB automatically based on cost and latency tradeoffs. In practice, a lot of inefficiency comes from people defaulting to one tool because switching feels risky or unclear. You could frame it as reducing operational risk and wasted compute rather than pure speed.

If you have to pay or take time off work to complete it, I strongly advise against this. If you’re going to pay $5,000-10,000 for a Bootcamp, you could at least get an accredited online degree in comp sci for the same price.

Most Bootcamps aren’t accredited so getting a certificate from one doesn’t mean anything to employers. A lot of bootcamps just churn out grads that all have the same generic projects and experience. Networking with the bootcamp grads in your program is rarely effective because a lot of them will not be able to break into the industry. I’ve seen bootcamps lie about their placements rates. Their website will say they have an 80% job placement rate or higher when there’s actually a lot of terms and conditions to exclude people who don’t make it into the industry from the count. If they were included, the real placement rate would be closer to 3%.

There may not be a guarantee with getting a job with the comp sci degree but at least it could get you past ATS and check the box. You would also be eligible to apply to new grad roles and new grad programs at larger companies.

First thing I do is slow down and try to understand *why* the data looks weird before touching anything. A lot of “bad data” turns out to be a legit business change no one told analytics about. New campaign, pricing tweak, tracking update, someone manually backfilled stuff… happens all the time. I’ll usually ping whoever owns the source early instead of guessing.

Then I separate “can we fix this upstream?” from “do we need a workaround right now?” If it’s a pipeline or tracking issue, I log it and try to get it fixed at the source. But if a stakeholder needs numbers today, I’ll do a temporary patch and clearly label it as such. I’ve learned the hard way to never quietly “just fix it” and move on.

I also keep a running notes doc per dataset. Nothing fancy, just “on X date this field broke because Y” or “these values are always missing on Mondays.” Future me (or the next analyst) will thank you.

Finally, I communicate way more than feels necessary. I’ll literally say, “These numbers are directionally right, but here’s what’s sketchy and what I’d be cautious about.” Most stakeholders are fine with imperfect data as long as they’re not surprised later.",1

1quoplu,6,"This is where your manager should step in. You are in a different role now and should prioritize tasks around your role. If they are still pushing when you say you can't do it because you are focusing on your tasks in the new position, it's your manager's job to block their crap.",6
1quoplu,7,"Tell your new manager. I have been a manager for a long time and see stuff like this all the time. I have no issue telling them (politely) to go swivel if necessary, or backing someone in your position who does so if you'd prefer.

To be honest this should all have been agreed between your manager and theirs when you moved role - how much transitional support they could expect, how long it would last, and a definitive end date where you won't offer that type of support any more. If your manager didn't do that work at the time, that's their mistake, and it's not too late for them to fix it but they need to go to work.",5

1quoplu,10,"This is really common after internal moves, especially when you were reliable in the old role. From the outside it feels harmless to them, but it quietly undermines your new job. I would not just silently absorb it or half do it, that tends to lock it in as an expectation.

What has worked for me is pushing it back into a prioritization conversation. Something like, happy to help, but I need alignment between my current manager and the old team on where this fits versus my data deliverables. That reframes it as a resourcing issue instead of a personal refusal. In a lot of cases the request disappears once it has to be justified upward.

If there are truly a few transitional tasks you still own, I would make them explicit and time boxed, not open ended decks. Otherwise the legacy creep never really stops and you end up doing two jobs, one of them invisible to your current team.",3

1qul1rj,2,That is the million dollar answer,2
1qul1rj,3,That's the larger question but what are the smaller questions? What does each attribute mean within the context of your data and why is it useful to have?,1
1qul1rj,4,"I had the same problem. The unlock for me was realizing attribution is not a decision engine, it’s a diagnostic tool.

What worked:

1. Stop asking which model is “right” Each model answers a different question. First-touch = demand creation Last-touch = demand capture Multi-touch = journey support They’re lenses, not truths.
2. Start with the business question, not the model. Budget allocation, channel cuts, scaling decisions all need different lenses. Lock the question first, then look at attribution.
3. Never act on attribution alone I only trust it when it lines up with revenue trends, CAC, margins, and incrementality tests. If attribution disagrees with real revenue, attribution loses.",1
1qul1rj,5," The way I approach it is to treat attribution data as directional, not absolute. Multi-touch models are helpful to see the broader journey, but I rarely make big decisions on last-click alone. I usually start by defining what “success” actually looks like for the campaign or business, conversions, qualified leads, revenue per channel, and then look for patterns across models rather than picking one as gospel. Signals that are consistent across multiple models get more weight, noisy spikes get flagged but rarely acted on immediately. Also, segmenting by cohort or campaign type helps avoid overreacting to outliers. Basically, use the data to guide hypotheses and test changes, instead of treating it as a single truth.

",1
1qul1rj,6,"the real problem you're describing isn't an analytics problem, it's a governance problem. when teams get to pick their own attribution model, of course they'll pick whatever makes them look good. we fixed this by locking one model per decision type, like first-touch for awareness budget decisions, last-click for conversion optimization, and publishing it in a shared doc that leadership signed off on. nobody gets to model-shop anymore. the data didn't change at all, we just removed the arguing.",1
1qul1rj,7,"Attribution only becomes useful once you stop treating any single model as the truth and start using them as directional signals. Most teams pick one primary model based on the decision they’re making, like last click for budget efficiency or first touch for demand generation, and use the others as a sense check instead of ammo for debates.

 The real value comes from looking at consistent patterns across models over time rather than reacting to week to week swings. Once you anchor decisions to trends and incremental tests like geo or channel experiments, attribution stops being a fight and starts being a supporting tool.",1
1qul1rj,8,We stopped chasing advice and started focusing on context. thewayhow helped us filter everything through our actual numbers and goals.,1
1qul1rj,9,"this is a really common spot to get stuck. the biggest shift for me was stopping attribution from being a scoreboard and using it as a directional tool. instead of asking “which channel gets credit,” i ask “what consistently shows up earlier or later in successful paths.” patterns over time matter way more than any single report.

i’ve also found it helps to decide in advance what decisions attribution is allowed to influence. like budget splits at a high level, not weekly tweaks. otherwise you end up chasing noise. when different models disagree, that’s usually the signal itself. it means the journey is complex, not that one team is right and another is wrong. attribution got more useful for me once i treated it as a way to ask better questions, not deliver definitive answers.",0

1qufmd2,2,"I see a lot of people make this jump without a big pay cut if they frame it as an internal shift, not a reset. With ten years in supply chain, you already have domain context that most entry level analytics folks do not. I would focus hard on SQL, basic Python, and showing you can answer real supply chain questions with data, not on piling up certifications. A masters can help, but only if it forces you to build projects you can talk through in detail. If you can show impact metrics from your current role, even small ones, it makes the transition conversation much easier. The analytics side usually values applied experience over formal credentials once you get in the door.",7
1qufmd2,3,"If you want to transition into data analytics, you have to signal to companies that you actually have the skills for the role. If I were starting over today, I would take MIT’s Applied Data Science program or CFI’s BIDA program to signal competence; both are significantly faster and more targeted than a traditional Master’s. The brand matters but it is not everything.

​Next, I would build a portfolio of projects within a specific niche. For me, that was business strategy. All my analytics projects were tailored to a single goal: increasing revenue and decreasing costs.

​Here are other pointers:
1. ​Master the Fundamentals: Familiarize yourself with common analytics tasks, industry lingo, and the frequent biases or mistakes that trip up juniors

2. ​Aggressive Pruning: Drop anything from your resume or linkedin that is not directly related to analytics or your specific industry. When recruiters read your resume, they should be convinced you’ve been an analyst for years

3. ​Tailor Your Experience: Frame every past role through an analytical lens. If you used Excel, Tableau, PySpark, or SQL—even for a small task—put it front and center as a core competency

4. ​Bridge the Gap: If you don't know the key skills required, check LinkedIn. If you don't have those skills yet, udemy to build a real-world project and prove you can do the work",6
1qufmd2,4,"Te dejo un par de consejillos:  
1. Certificaciones: en Data Analytics, como la de Google Data Analytics o Certified Analytics Professional (CAP). También las de Supply Chain Analytics como las de APICS o SCPro pueden ser útiles.

2. Cursos: en análisis de datos o en business intelligence podría ser una excelente opción, pero si el presupuesto es un problema, considera cursos más cortos y específicos en plataformas como Coursera, edX o Udemy.

3. Puedes destacar tu experiencia en gestión de la cadena de suministro y cómo esa base te da una ventaja para analizar datos y optimizar procesos en ese campo. El análisis de datos dentro de la cadena de suministro está muy en demanda, y tu background en transporte te da un enfoque único.

4. Empieza a trabajar en proyectos personales de análisis de datos, como analizar tendencias o patrones en la logística de transporte, y muestra esos proyectos en tu CV o LinkedIn.",1
1qufmd2,5,"If your company has an analytics team find out what problems they are working on and which ones are the most valuable. Talk to the team manager and find out what kind of credentials she/he's looking for. If there are any problems the analytic team doesn't have the time to solve, make that your project. If the company doesn't have a formal team, become it.",1
1qufmd2,6,"You’re actually in a good spot because ten years of supply chain experience is hard to replace and analytics skills are teachable. You don’t need a full reset or a big pay cut if you target supply chain or operations analytics roles instead of generic entry level data analyst jobs. A master’s can help but isn’t required if you build strong SQL, Excel, and BI skills and can show projects tied to transportation costs, service levels, or forecasting. The key is positioning yourself as someone who understands the business deeply and can now analyze it, not as someone starting over.",1

What tends to stick is the work around framing vague questions, understanding messy business context, deciding what data is actually trustworthy, and translating results into decisions people will act on. Those are the parts junior roles often underemphasize, which is why it feels shaky right now. Teams still need people who can reason about data in context, not just produce outputs.

If you’re aiming long term at data or ML adjacent roles, analytics can still be a good entry point if you lean into domain understanding and system thinking, not just tooling.

1qtml5c,3,"A lot of beginners overestimate how much fancy math or algorithms matter for BA and DA roles. In practice, most teams care far more about whether you can take a messy business question, get the right data, and explain the result clearly. SQL, basic statistics, spreadsheets, and one scripting language are usually enough to get started. DSA and LeetCode are rarely central unless the role is drifting toward pure data engineering.

One common mistake is trying to learn everything at once, especially AI. It is usually better to get solid at asking good questions, cleaning data, and building simple analyses before layering anything advanced on top. Weakness in math is not a deal breaker for many analytics roles, but avoiding it entirely can limit growth later. Focus on understanding concepts, not formulas.

The job market is tough right now, so projects that show real problem solving matter more than certificates. Even small, well explained projects can help if they show how you think.

1. Make it clear to the PM (or other appropriate manager) that tracking metrics need to be included in the original requirements and implemented alongside the feature

2. When they ask ""How is the feature performing?"", and the metrics to answer this don't exist, then pass the request to the PM and wait until the metrics have been implemented

so, basically: you need to evangelize about the need/importance of having analytics. it sucks, but it always ends up being part of the job. you need ro raise awareness, and this will also mean you will become more important and may get more visiblity. then, if you provide enough value and good business insight, they will give you more work (and maybe, just maybe, more money)",3

If you're okay with making a living and some extra that you can dedicate to people or meaningful causes, it's easier to feel like your job is meeting expectations, even when it's frustrating.",12
1qsaaje,4,"Look for a new job. Caveat if you’re under a director/VP who really cares about data, process, and infrastructure. If not? Good luck.

Been in your shoes more than once. Most recently joined as a lead, didn’t have a boss, then reported to the new CFO, then he left, then I was moved to the new “data team” under a VP who didn’t even check tickets until weekly standup.

I thought it was a great opportunity to build a data function, only to be drowning in technical debt and absurd last minute requests. Every time I was given a “critical” task they’d change the requirements and then I’d be blamed for delays. I’d be blamed for legacy data in systems I didn’t know about. I was blamed when people used data incorrectly because they didn’t read the brief FAQ on the data.

I was “laid off” 8 months in, and my entire team quit within a few months of that. AFAIK they went back to consultants and making a bigger mess.

Do what you can, but unless you have someone leading the way, you’re going to spiral. Prepare to exit on your terms.",8
1qsaaje,5,Same started half a year ago at a small company where I report directly to the new vp. But the vp is surrounded in political problems and it trickles down to me. The only thing that has been helping me is finding outside projects and speaking up about worries to my manager. This is not advice but being able to say to my manager that I am having issues with project direction with my direct manager has been really helpful. But just do it in a way that doesn’t put the blame on anyone(at least in the team),1
1qsaaje,6,"Suck to hear that but nothing that can't be properly managed.

First things first, work with the current system to flesh out what are the priority projects.  If management can flesh that out, use best judgment and say based on the current business demand, these are the projects the team is going to work on for Q2.  

Ensure you are talking with your stakeholders consistently, also book time with other managers to understand the current landscape.  Also to understand if it is normal or if they are seeing the same issues",1
1qsaaje,7,been there and it is harder than the technical work honestly. what helped me was accepting that chaos early on is often not somethiing you can fix quickly. i started settiing really clear boundaries around what was actually my responsibility and letting the rest exist without carrying it home. writing things down helped too because it made the mess feel finiite instead of emotional. if leadership keeps changing focus i treat my role as learniing how the org works rather than trying to win every fight. it does get easier once you stop tying your sense of fairness to outcomes you cannot control.,1
1qsaaje,8,"I have been in environments like that, and what helped most was narrowing my sense of responsibility. When everything is messy, it is easy to feel like you have to absorb all the chaos, but that is usually not true or healthy. I started defining very clearly what I own, what I influence, and what is just noise I document and move past. Writing things down helped a lot, especially decisions, assumptions, and requests, because it creates mental distance and protects you when priorities shift. On the personal side, having a hard stop ritual after work helped me reset, even something simple like a walk or changing rooms before doing anything else. It does not fix the situation, but it makes it easier to survive it while you decide if it is a place you want to stay long term.",1
1qsaaje,9,"This is really common in chaotic analytics orgs, especially during leadership churn. One helpful shift is separating “this system is messy” from “I’m doing a bad job.” A lot of urgency comes from weak prioritization upstream, not from you.

Setting small boundaries helps. Clarify assumptions in writing, agree on what “good enough” means for urgent asks, and notice when you’re over-investing emotionally because you care, not because it’s required.

Also pay attention to whether the chaos is temporary or structural. Detaching a bit isn’t disengaging, it’s protecting your energy so you can make clear decisions.",1
1qsaaje,10,"Are you part of a centralized reporting team or is it decentralized? If you are the only analyst, then yes it will be very chaotic until you can get some more help. If you are part of a team and have a workflow system, then lean on that heavily to help you prioritize your work. If your direct manager is aloof and doesn’t understand data, start building relationships with the stakeholders directly. Communicate with them on a weekly basis to go over their tickets to talk about progress. Use those meetings to set clear expectations on prioritization. When it is chaotic and everything is a firedrill, that means there needs to be better communication cadence both ways, to and from the stakeholder. Setting up a communication cadence will help solve a lot of these pain points that you are feeling, and it will surface the amount of outstanding work that could enable hiring more resources.",1

I've found having clear documentation on how metrics are calculated helps with the agenda pushing. When someone asks for favorable recalculations, you can point to the documented logic. Doesn't always win the argument but at least keeps you consistent.

Try this:

* Always compare (vs benchmark, different periods).
* Ask “when does this break?” more than “when does it win?”

It provides a variety of performance metrics and views into your strategy's results. Plus, it has a community where you can learn more about interpreting backtest results and improving your strategy.

e.g. their KPI will have 5-6 key drivers and they will only have data on 1-2, so any attempt at serious analysis ends up with a huge amount of noise

This is totally normal in business because usually data is just a random byproduct of operational processes, rather than something that has been mindfully gathered to facilitate explanation and research. And unless it’s customer-related, businesses usually don’t want to invest in capturing the right data. They just want you to use what they’ve got

As a result a lot of data analysis is nonsense/pseudoscience

But that is okay because management only ever uses your analysis when it supports their schemes for career advancement",50
1qry3px,3,It more bothers me when people start applying statistical analysis to data without checking if they even can... for example SDs when data isn't normally distributed. People forget how outliers skew SD but are happy to continue with their SD analysis. Often IQR is the better option. Even those who get this often then forget to look at coefficients of variation.

""The vendor's payment terms in the report isn't what I agreed with the vendor"" => ""We have a data quality issue""

Mate, your data quality is fine. The issues you have are:

1. Not understanding different KPI definitions for different purposes but comparing them anyway
2. Process issues due to demanding too high detail level in classifications that probably aren't well defined or mutually exclusive, and that you probably don't use for anything anyway.
3. Not understanding the underlying business process that generates the data you're looking at
4. Missing or incomplete masterdata maintenance processes

Your data ""quality"" itself is probably fine (ETL, modeling, etc.), but everything around your process that generates the data are probably shit.

1qry3px,9,"Yeah I think you're right. I have a customer and there were so many myths that they were terrible at data and their system was a complete mess and mystery. Actually it's fine. Most data quality issues come from misuse of data going in, for example mistakes or errors that aren't picked up like picking a date for 2062 instead of the actual year and for things like this it's the software front end at fault. But in my opinion no-one is going to fix that until it's in a report and they can see that they have a 40 year outlier. 

That said there are databases which are frustrating, one of these for me is the fact less fact table we have that makes everything incredibly slow. The main customer number is also stored as text 000123 for example and 234556 so if you try and export data or work with it in power BI or power query the number of times things don't join up because of it not being int or string is infuriating. For a while because of the fun fact less fact we even had dates stored as id to link to another table with a date in it. That was something else and I avoided that but it was our main record system for 80% of activity in the organisation 

Ditto that many analytics teams have awful quality work, it seems rich to preach about data quality when your model doesn't allow anyone to filter anything useful or is just wrong. I have colleagues that say they spend 80% of their time data cleansing but I don't think that's possible. No",2

Most institutions only allow analysis through their reporting interface or custom extracts that have to be requested and approved, especially because of PHI and governance rules.

 In a lot of cases you need to work with your internal Vizient admin or analytics team to define a cohort and get a deidentified extract pulled for you. If that’s not possible, many capstones end up being more methodology or insight focused using Vizient reports rather than raw row level data.",2

1qr9xhd,3,"Before the hype of analytics and data science, ""Decision Support"" or ""Decision Science"" was a job function. I feel like today's analytics and business-facing data science roles have replaced those teams/roles, but the purpose is the same - support business decisions. The business does not care how you do it, what technical tools you use; you could just use basic arithmetic in Excel as long as it answers relevant questions and you frame your insights in a way they understand, with recommendations they can implement.",10
1qr9xhd,4,"What really matters is how you help people in your role.  That's the high level I've leaned heavily on in my 10+ year DA career.

Solve problems.

Provide data insights.

Fix reports and align data.

Help people get to crucial information they need so they can get out of the reports and spend time doing what they do best.

The more you help people with data, the more opportunities you get to do the job.  You can use whatever tools you need to get it done, but what matters is getting it done and delivering it to people who need it.

Because you could be amazing at producing the work. But if noone sees it or even uses it, it doesn't matter.  Sure you may get better at improving some technical skills or critical thinking, but without engaging and helping the stakeholders regularly and in a meaningful matter, you miss out on building real domain knowledge that can be leveraged in future work.

And the more people you help, the more problems you solve builds your reputation so that more people want to bring more problems to you to solve.  You get more interesting challenges where likely you won't know how to do, but that's part of the job.  We figure it out through research, testing, and learning.

My advice to juniors is always focus on who you are helping.  Ask good questions and try to understand how you are helping them.  You can go and devote all your time to being a technical guru, but you need to use those skills to get your stakeholders what they need to make decisions.   And also developing communication skills because you can be a genius but if people cant understand what youre saying, it doesnt matter.

So back to the question at hand: messier or cleaner environments just present the type of challenge or frequency of problems.  I would saw messier environments could be great training grounds but if you arent helping fix problems or help people, it could be just adding data to a problem that won't read it.  It only helps you learn how to survive.  A cleaner environment with people who dont care about data means you could push reports that never go anywhere because stakes are low.  A cleaner environment where it is designed due to high competency in a company presents other unique challenges where you can work on optimizing or building new tools or reports or explore new ideas where in a messy it may just be filled with putting out fires.

I have been in both.  The messy environment taught me work ethic and how to do things quickly.  The clean environment taught me how to push those skills further and handle more meaningful problems (while reducing my stress significantly).

But again, experiences may vary.",12
1qr9xhd,5,"AI or not, I'll add to the sentiments of the OP.

It's the over-extension of the software development world into the analytics space.

'Tools and toys' over understanding, and actual problem solving. SQL doesn't solve problems, but SQL can be used in solving problems.

Also tool vendors want you to believe their products make one an analyst, and not skills.

Then again I am one of those kooks who things 'programing' is a skill distinct from learning a language syntax.",5
1qr9xhd,6,"I totally agree with this! In early analytics roles, it’s often more about solving real-world problems with the tools you have rather than knowing every tool perfectly. Messy data, ambiguous questions, and working with imperfect stakeholders really forces you to develop problem-solving skills and adaptability. It teaches you to prioritize finding insights, even when things aren’t neat or perfect.

If I could go back, I’d optimize for embracing messy environments earlier. The experience you get from working through those challenges is what really builds a solid foundation for handling complex, real-world problems later on. It's not about the clean, controlled environments you see in tutorials, but more about navigating the chaos and learning how to extract value from it.",3
1qr9xhd,7,"100% agree. Early on, the messy environments teach you way more. You’re forced to translate vague questions into metrics, deal with broken data, and explain tradeoffs to non technical people, and that skill compounds. Clean stacks are great later, but learning to operate in ambiguity is what actually makes you useful.",2
1qr9xhd,8,"Tools dont matter, only job done. If you can do it in excel, go excel, if you want traceability, learn a programming language , whatever gets the job done. This fight i see on the internet over tools is stupid in my opinion.

Edit: like where i work at, i use R, but my colleague uses a mix of excel and a software specific for our field, and we do the same work in the end. Sure some tools can make your life easy but again... If you prefer python, go python, if you want to go with R, go R, if you can do your job just fine in excel, go excel, same with power BI. 

Im a jr and started obsessed with tools, but in the end, whatever works for you and your team is fine , in my inexperienced opinion, or whatever tool that asks your job/field to know.",-2

Now, your next role? Absolutely.

I'm 4 YOE as a DA and made Senior after my second year. Taking interviews now and I will absolutely negotiate. I actually negotiated higher for this role in 2022 when I got it, but I was a business analyst prior so this was more of a pivot.",20
1qqo0ln,3,"In general, always negotiate if you feel you have compelling reasons for it. Research, list them and counter offer as to why it deserves that bump. At worst, they say sorry but we want you and this is it. If you do get another small bump, great. 

However, let’s be analytical in how a business looks at it. You were making $25/hour. Now 70K puts you at ~$33.65/hr. That changes your annual income 34.6%! More than any usual annual increase without job hopping and typically around 20-25%. You are much better off than before. Add in other perks like PTO, healthcare benefits, etc and overall negotiating wouldn’t change it probably.

1qqo0ln,7," First off, congratulations on the new role! It sounds like a great step forward in your career. It’s totally normal to have those second thoughts, especially early in your career. Many people in similar situations accept offers without negotiating because they’re focused on getting their foot in the door, and that’s valid, especially if stability and experience are the top priorities.

In terms of salary, it’s important to remember that starting out is about learning and gaining experience, which you’re doing. As you continue to grow in your role and gain more specialized skills, you’ll be in a better position to negotiate more confidently for future roles. And yes, this job should definitely give you experience to move into better opportunities down the line. If you're happy with the role and the company, you’re setting a solid foundation for your career. When you're ready for your next move, you'll have more leverage to negotiate based on your proven value.

So, in short, yes, this is totally normal, and you’re on the right track! Keep learning, and when it’s time for your next role, you’ll be able to approach negotiations with more knowledge and confidence.",3
1qqo0ln,8,Like others have said it doesn’t hurt to ask but I would just accept it. This economy is pretty rough so having an offer is great and after spending a couple years at this job + your masters opens up loads of great opportunities down the road with much higher pay:,1

1qqewe8,2,Welcome to Merkle I guess,5
1qqewe8,3,this is not a dumb question at all and a lot of people worry about this early on. learniing qualtrics willl not lock you into a non technical path but it will give you exposure to how data is collected and used in real orgs. you can frame it later as experience working with customer data and insightss not just the tool itself. if you keep some coding projects on the side you can protect that part of your profile while still learning how analytics shows up in business.,3
1qqewe8,4,"It is a fair concern, and not a dumb question at all. The certification itself will not carry huge weight on its own, but the context around it can. What matters more is whether you can frame the work as learning how data is collected, structured, and turned into decisions, not just clicking around a tool. If you stay close to survey design, data quality, and analysis outputs, it can complement an AIML background rather than derail it. Two years later, people will care less about the tool name and more about whether you can explain how you worked with messy, real world data and stakeholders. Try to keep at least a light coding or analysis angle alive on the project so your resume tells a coherent story.",2
1qqewe8,5,It will be helpful if you interview with a team that uses Qualtrics - so many product analytics or maybe marketing analytics. But it’s a niche tool - some teams might use a competitor tool or no VoC tool at all. ,2

1qqe21t,2,"What type of projects/tasks are you doing now? And how do you envision a data science role being different? 

There is so much overlap between analytics and data science - I’m a data scientist who has worked on business analytics and product analytics teams. My projects and tasks are a mix of reporting, basic analysis, and some statistics and predictive modeling. The difference between data analyst and data scientist on a lot of teams isn’t that one is always doing predictive work, but that they have a broad skillset they can bring to the problems they solve. 

Does your company offer tuition assistance? I would take advantage of that and start a part-time masters sooner rather than later. That’s what I did and it took me 4 years to finish, but I was able to get a more advanced data analytics role while still enrolled and then my title was changed to data scientist before I graduated. Even if you leave your company and have to pay back tuition benefits, if you get a nice salary bump (and sign on bonus), it’s still worth it - that was the case for me. 

But I would also try to do more data science work in your current role. Even with basic reporting, you can start doing things like calculating outliers or confidence intervals or checking p-values or correlations or doing regressions. Start thinking more about the assumptions or hypotheses your company has and how you can test or validate them. They likely wont come to you with data science projects because they don’t know what’s possible - start identifying opportunities for them. This is a big part of a data scientist’s job. ",19
1qqe21t,3,"Your plan is actually quite reasonable, and you’re not being unrealistic. Moving from analyst to data scientist is hard and slow for most people, especially without a formal DS title on the resume.

I believe, Applying for a few months while upskilling is fine.",2
1qqe21t,4,"I actually did the path you are on. I was a data analyst for 3 years before transitioning to data scientist. The only difference was I went the Masters route before applying for data scientist positions. 

I think your overall strategy is a good one. I definitely wouldn't wait any longer than May to get into a master's program in data science. Furthermore the focus should be getting out within 2 years or less. 

The reason is that at a certain point, assuming you're being compensated fairly, your salary as a senior data analyst may exceed that of an entry level data scientist.  Meaning that you will have to take a pay cut to transition. That was something I was worried about.",2

I've been constantly asked to react to analyses that business teams produced using their self-service data access. Sometimes this is because those contradict findings that came from my data science team and stakeholders are confused so we have to explain to them all the stuff we accounted for that they weren't thinking of. Some issues cropping up:

* Special events: we have things like marketing promotions or outages that would cause large changes in many KPIs. Many of these events are undocumented, as in, there is no source of truth contextual dataset where something like ""widespread Azure outage took down the app for six hours on this day"", ""marketing operations failed to deploy a push communication for a one-day sale and could only sent it out to Android devices hours later"", or ""some locations in part of the USA were closed or operated with shorter hours due to a hurricane"". We have many informal cottage versions of these curated by different analytics teams but nothing promoted to the official self-service analytics because there is no one business owner or governance process when you have so many internal and external drivers both large and small. That leads to some person who is working in, say, marketing looking at and reacting to trends including data from years ago with periods affected by severe weather or a platform error or a supply chain disruption. They end up spending a lot of time spinning their wheels with no clue why they are seeing what they are seeing, or even worse, seeding stories with their department's leaders about how their specific focus led to those results and wanting to double down on investments in their turf when it had nothing to do with it.

* Seasonality: beyond special events, we have strong seasonality to most business patterns, including time of day, day of week, and week of year components. Most non-analysts seem to have no clue how to handle these appropriately. I saw a lot of instances when they were looking at data for a particular segment of interest and would derive some kind of growth rate comparing to an arbitarily chosen baseline period or week on week trend, and then they'd storytell and hypothesize about why we saw growth/declines in that segment. They would complete miss things like *all* segments having similar changes over this time period and that this was just normal seasonality.

* Simpson's paradox: most non-analysts are not thinking about potential issues caused by shifts in the underlying population over time, and this can lead to all kinds of misinterpretations. As an oversimplified example, suppose you have two types of customers, power users and casual users. Each group separately is showing higher revenue per user now compared to two years ago. Additionally, marketing efforts have focused on acquiring casual users and so this segment is much larger now than it was two years ago, while power users was saturated and there aren't more now compared to then. Someone might naively look at revenue per user across all customers and see that is going down and sound the alarm, but what's actually happening is dilution in this metric by the larger share of casual users.",3
1qqd9kr,9,"No “Analytical” jobs are not necessarily going this way but I suspect “Data Analyst” jobs, as we know it, will dissipate.

Ultimately, access to data, manipulating data, and visualizing data is very accessible today and I think many Data Analyst jobs live in this realm. If your data lives in a spreadsheet and/or has relatively few data points and the interest is solely on the current state of the data, then anyone can do the Data Analyst job. This was always going to happen for roles that were solely defined this way. Truly the differentiator in this scenario is your ability to manipulate data to answer complex questions, the speed at which you can manipulate data, and how accessible your report it.

Taking it a step further, you mentioned ‘models.’ Not everyone can make ‘models’ but it depends on how you define ‘models.’ If you’re talking about anything you can do on excel, then anyone can ‘model’ with the help of a LLM. On the other hand, if you’re talking about useful, actionable models, then only the person who has a good understanding of the data, understands the workflow and how the data was generated, and has a good understanding of the stochastic properties of the data can create a truly good model. That right there is enough to make someone irreplaceable because only the Data Analyst has the time and exposure to do this. 

The final aspect is domain expertise, which is a product of the latter two. So yes, in my opinion, if your role and/or company has none of these, I would find it difficult for the “Data Analyst” role to be safe.",3

The market is crazy tight right now! So I’m not saying it will be like job hopping to level up your skills a few years ago. But keeping yourself up to date is hard but very important throughout your career. 

You will find a lot more of that structure at a larger org or a place that has some solid history. When you’re speaking with the employers, or reviewing the job descriptions, look for mentions of ticketing systems and project management tools. 

But while you’re where you are, you could do a lot of this yourself! It’s hard to build things like this, but it will feel rewarding! And at the level you’re at, it will be a solid play towards a promotion. 
(Honestly, it gets harder to get a promotion the higher up you go, and there are points where this kind of work will not be seen as helpful, but where you’re at is the right place, imo). 

You need to take the data request or analysis request process that either exists or doesn’t, and revamp or make one. 

Let’s say there is one already. Edit it. Make sure there is a - presentation (short) that tells people why you’re doing this and what you will create out of it. - new templates for intake. You’ve had it happen a few times now: you’ve seen people come to you and they already have in mind what they want at the end. You need to make those questions explicit. Be direct. - in your process, include a 30 min requirements meeting. Send the doc out in advance and require it for the meeting. Push them in the meeting, politely but firmly. And point out where you see what you’re concerned about. Do not be afraid to say, “I hear you’re telling me you want x. Why do you think that is the answer you will get? What can the data bring that will be new for you?” Or “I hear you want to validate that y is happening. What will happen if the data shows something else?” 

In that form and meeting: nail down the outcome. What do they want: a table of summary info? A spreadsheet with various elements? Make them commit. When you’re done, you send it to them and say, ok it’s completed per the request. Have them file requests to go further in writing and count each round of edits. 

Present to your boss when you finish requests and rounds of edits in counts, in writing, in your check-ins with them. 

Keep your own log of projects, with a descriptions of what you did, like you’re writing your own performance review, all year long",2

Then you can start working on projects that improve their work. Make it easier and quicker for them to do their job. If it’s taking someone 20+ minutes to run a report or analysis, maybe build them a tool to make that easier so that they can spend more time on the floor. 

Communicate with leaders on what’s important to them and see how you can help them reach their goals with your tools.

There are other tools like Colibri and Alation. It all depends on how much you're willing to spend. Establishing a data governance at a company can be challenging if there is no ""buy-in"". We usually recommend our customer to start with a data strategy, it helps create a road map to generate value from their data, identify gaps, data swot analysis, and come up with the data products.

1qp3mq5,2,"We have ChatGPT enterprise and I’ll tell ya, it’s great for Dax formulas and it can scrape resources in a fraction of the time it would take me to.

In my experience, AI is great for bouncing ideas off of, getting a DAX starting point, and grouping large sets of qualitative data.

The downsides are I worry that I don’t learn without exploration and testing and a lack of repeatable actions.

Example, today I built a report showing actual performance for this month and earlier + forecasted performance for the remainder of the fiscal year, and a measure to give me the result as a title e.g. 0+12 act/fcst, which in march will be 3+9.

That would have taken me probably a day or two of deep work to rationalize my way through and make it work and test it.  I had an answer in 10 minutes of back and forth, implemented in another 10.

But I didn’t gain discovery. 

For analysis, it’s great at reading thousands of customer comments or repair logs.  But that’s a one time thing. It’s not like ChatGPT is part of the power query into power bi, so if your dataset was skewed, then the summary that you compare all future results will be skewed too.

Beyond all of that, any time I’ve tried to use it via copilot in power bi to ChatGPT I get surface level observations at best and nonsensical garbage at worst. 

It’s scary how confident it replies though, and I worry about those who blindly trust it, yet question human formulas til the cows come home.",15

Recruiters message my peers and myself fairly often as well. I never found it too difficult to transition between industries. The industry knowledge is often understood to be a learning process in my experience. Most companies just care if you can work with the data. They’ll teach you all the acronyms and business jargon. That said, there can be challenges for example when I was in biotech I basically had to reteach myself basic biology, but that’s most likely an extreme. 

I too have anxiety around a layoff as I was laid off once before. It’s hard to overcome.

The bigger risk is overspecializing in healthcare specific tooling or definitions without keeping your core analytics skills sharp. If you stay strong on SQL, data modeling, pipelines, and explaining results to non technical stakeholders, moving to another industry is very doable. I have seen people jump from healthcare to fintech, retail, or ops analytics without too much friction. The anxiety is understandable, but with eight years total experience and hybrid analyst dev skills, you are not locked in.

The Medicaid and Medicare work in particular builds muscles that transfer well, things like compliance constraints, imperfect data, and explaining results to non technical stakeholders.

Do you need to embed only published dashboards/reports, or a report builder too?",1
1qoy7g8,4,Qlik OEM is perfect for your need case.,1
1qoy7g8,5,"the white labelling on stylebi is pretty good, lots of flexibility in the look and feel to match the look of the broader product",1
1qoy7g8,6,"I love this question  — I've lived in myself. A little background so that you know where I'm coming from. I built embedded analytics into four different SaaS applications at three different companies, and since then, have worked for a number of different vendors that offer embedded analytics. I've seen the good, the bad, and the ugly. And having purchased embedded analytics as a product owner, I feel like I've got a good sense of what's important. That said, keep in mind that I currently work for a vendor, Pyramid Analytics, but I'll give you my thoughts based on having done it myself. 

First, when I worked at one company as a product leader, we did both a buy AND a build at the same time. We had a really talented engineering team building our ""operational analytics,"" and then we purchased another tool for our ad hoc analytics. The very limited, ""build it ourselves"" that we created ended up costing more than the analytics we purchased and had about 1/10 the functionality. Six months in we had static, inflexible charting that was a nightmare to manage. Honestly, I would never build my own analytics again based on what I've experienced in the past. 

The trick with buying analytics is that you really have to think about what you're going to need long term so that you don't outgrow you so the tool ended up having to rip everything out and replace it in a couple of years. The things that people never think about are 1. scaling past the first couple of customers, 2. the ability to add tiers like Basic, Plus and Pro, so you can do upsells over time, and like you mentioned, 3. deep customization. 

Here's where I'm going to talk a little bit about Pyramid and some of the stuff that we offer. Early on, as a SaaS product owner, I ran into a problem of purchasing a tool that looked great, but once we started to scale a little bit, we ran into all sorts of hidden costs, and even worse, the management of it all. Things like one customer on one variant of the analytics, another on a second variant of the analytics, etc, started to become a huge issue. We ended up having to do tons of manual effort to keep it running. At Pyramid, we have an embedding hub that makes it super easy to embed to manage all your embeds. For example, we have one customer that has over 50,000 users and only 2 admins to manage the whole thing.

The second item is those tiers of offering. Again early in my career as a product owner, I made the mistake of purchasing a tool that was kind of ""all or nothing""  — you could either turn everything on or you could turn everything off, but you couldn't offer specific features by user or by group. One of the nice things about Pyramid Analytics is that we can turn features on and off, even while embedding, all the way down to the user level. Now, you probably wouldn't do this. Instead, you'd create groups like basic tier, plus tier, pro tier, and turn features on by group. So you might offer very simple view only analytics for the basic tier, the ability to perform ad hoc discovery for the plus tier, and enable AI-powered causation and forecasting for that pro tier, just as an example. This gives you the ability as a product person to be really creative in the way you structure your SaaS product analytics. 

The third thing I mentioned was deep customization. This is where Pyramid Analytics really shines. Like you, I'm not a fan of iFrames. They're kind of clunky, and as you embed more of them on a page, everything becomes significantly slower. At Pyramid, we have something called direct code injection  — you can pick any element, a single number, a chart, comma or an entire dashboard, and click the embed button. From there, you get a bunch of options, one of which is direct injection using JavaScript, React, or a few other options. You take the code and just place it under your page. Boom, you're good to go. And the great thing is, you can embed multiple of these elements on a page without slowing anything down. On top of that, it's incredibly customizable. I've seen examples where our customers make the analytics look exactly like their SaaS application. You would never know it's Pyramid Analytics. I've seen others where they're fine with having some Pyramid looking elements show, but the nice thing is that's all up to you. You can customize it exactly how you want. 

I'm happy to give you more information if you'd like — just reach out to me and we can talk. Good luck!",1
1qoy7g8,7,"We were in the same spot. Building it yourself turns into a never-ending list. auth, tenant scoping, filters, saved views, permissions, performance, and then making it look like it belongs in your app.

We ended up using Tractorscope for customer-facing dashboards because it let us embed analytics without the “random iframe BI page” vibe, and we could match it to our UI enough that users didn’t feel like they left the product. Biggest advice. test tenant isolation and your slowest dashboard early. That’s where most teams get burned.",1
1qoy7g8,8,"if your goal is “feels native, doesn’t drain eng bandwidth,” embedded analytics > rolling your own almost every time. we ended up with Zoho Analytics, mainly because it let us white-label hard  themes, fonts, filters, even URL-based embedding and hope our customers are feeling home. haha",1

That's how many companies have been burned by designers, developers, marketers, etc. that essentially old their domain hostage if they want to stop working with them.

If a change is needed, a *capable* and *experienced* agency will be able to work with the stakeholders that do control those things.

Also, when working with enterprise-level clients - those that likely have their own internal web dev or product team - a good agency will be able to work seamlessly with them to implement all of their recommended technical changes, analytics implementations, optimization, etc.

I got my start with these kinds of clients over 15 years ago; while I had access to their analytics and such, it was a few years before I ever worked with someone where I had direct access to even their CMS.",2

1qocxkk,2,"From this post, it sounds like you showed up at a new job and started telling everyone that they were doing a bad job and needed to change, without first understanding what had already been done or why it works the way it does. 

Now, I'm not saying that you're wrong, or that's what's actually happening. It's definitely possible that things worked terribly before. But I would definitely encourage you to figure out more about how that massive Power BI file works before you make any more requests about changing things. 

OK, so you said the file breaks whenever you touch it. Can you be more specific? There's probably a workaround.

Also, depending on what kind of company this is, immediately suggesting that you don't have the tools to get the job done and needing to upgrade the whole tech stack is a bad look. Small companies may not have the budget for this; you may need to work within your limitations.",12
1qocxkk,3,"Yeah, the problem is not Power BI itself. it is that your data is stuck inside reports instead of a proper database. Ask for the raw data to land in Azure tables first, cleaned and refreshed incrementally, So you can query it with SQL. I think BI should read the data not be the data.",3
1qocxkk,4,"First of all I agree the mega pbix file as the data source is frustrating, but I guess I need context here:

Is the problem the file is so big your computer can't run it well? If so req a laptop with more RAM (like 32 at least)

Is the problem the fields/tables names aren't very clear so you want to look at the backend? Maybe go to the CIO team and ask if there's a data dictionary or something. Sometimes theres not and you just need to figure it out and find a senior who knows WTF is going on.

If it's just ""this shit legit doesn't work because its reaching critical mass for a pbix file"" then say that then run it up the ladder. If there's other people successfully using this pbix monstrosity then maybe set some time up and go over it with them.",2
1qocxkk,5,"This is a really common spot to end up in, and your frustration makes sense. What you are running into is less a tooling problem and more a boundary problem between analytics and data engineering ownership.

One way to reframe the conversation is to stop asking for “the backend data” and instead ask for clarity on the data contracts. Where does the Azure database sit in the flow, what entities are modeled there, how often they refresh, and which ones are considered authoritative. Even if you never get Snowflake, you need something you can reason about without reverse engineering a giant Power BI file.

In the short term, you might respond by agreeing to work from KPIs while also asking for a lightweight way to query the underlying tables that feed those KPIs. Frame it as risk reduction and efficiency, not preference. Right now all the logic lives in one fragile artifact, and that is a single point of failure. Long term, you will probably need to draw a line between “I can report” and “I can analyze.” Without access to stable, quarriable tables, real analysis just is not possible, and that is worth making explicit.",2
1qocxkk,6,"Yeah… this setup is way too familiar 😅  
A giant PBIX acting as the “source of truth” is basically tech debt with a nice UI on top.

I wouldn’t argue tools at all here. The real issue is that all the logic lives inside a fragile file. If it breaks, changes, or the original author disappears, you’re stuck reverse-engineering measures instead of doing analysis.

Short term, I’d stop treating the PBIX as *the* data source and start asking basic questions about what actually exists in Azure: what’s refreshed, what’s incomplete, what’s supposed to be canonical. Even a couple of clean, queryable views would be a huge win.

Long term, analytics needs logic in a place you can query and reason about. Power BI should be a consumer, not the brain. Otherwise every question turns into “open the PBIX and pray.”",1
1qocxkk,7,"This is literally my fear. FiveTran and Snowflake are the GOAT. What you describe is my fucking nightmare. 

Something similar happened to me after my company got acquired and the new company wanted to do things their way, which was every single KPI living in one single massive table instead of being normalized. Like, they didn’t have an orders table, an items-in-the-orders table, an items table, and a site metrics table. That I could then join together (or not) according to what I needed in my report. Everything just lived in ONE giant massive table.

You’re new so you don’t have any street cred there so they aren’t going to listen to you. I have no idea why there are engineers and CTOs out there who think this is how to work with data when Snowflake and FiveTran are a thing along with simple documentation about how to set this up but I guess they all went to the same college for dumbasses 10 years ago and think this is right.

Anyway. Speaking as a DA/BA, one reason they probably want you to use their ridiculous file is they’re doing some kind of transformations on the metrics on the backend that you won’t be able to replicate. (This is how after pushing and pushing and pushing for access to the raw data I finally got some of the parent tables and discovered they weren’t converting Canadian sales into USD. Yeah fuck you Kartick.) But a less stupid reason might be they remove fraudulent orders which are cancelled in a different system. Or they are converting the time zones. Or they remove bot traffic.

I had to quit for mental health reasons but you have to do the best with what you have. Ask a lot of questions and get some actual workshopping in about the Power BI table (there might be stupid tricks to save it from crashing that you don’t know about) and if there really isn’t you can document the crashing and prove how unusable their data is which will enable you to “pass the football” as they “fix” it. Build good reports off what data you have and expand to other departments—this is how my career went when it was going well. Then you can ask for more tools to get the job done.",1
1qocxkk,8,Skill issue,1
1qocxkk,9,"This is not a stack problem, but a documentation one. No one understands the existing flows because institutional knowledge lives only in the last person's head. Ask how did reporting work before you arrived? And where's the data dictionary for the Power BI transformations? Focus on information access, not stack changes, document the crashing behaviour, and escalate as a single point of failure. Someone should know this work before they connect SF and Dynamics to Azure somehow, maybe using ETL tools like Windsor.ai or Fivetran, as you suggested.",1
1qocxkk,10,"Can you figure out the dataflows? Chucking advanced editor into copilot can be handy. Guessing not though because if you can get into the dataflows you can get into the source. Can you use the pbix file as the source, connect to it and rearrange the tables? Not done that myself but so much is possible these days ",1

No burst reporting
Difficulty in creating cross chart interactions

for data analysis, starting simple helped me. use ai to help clean data, write queries, or explain what a chart is actually showing. once that feels natural, then automating pieces makes sense. a lot of linkedin posts are highlight reels, not the messy middle where things break and need babysitting. you are probably not as behind as it feels.",14

When presented with a business question, many of our stakeholders just assume we will build a scalable re-usable power Bi report, but often its over-kill or mis-aligned with business priorities. We can waste weeks developing something scalable and re-usable just to find that no one is using it. In response, we started using AI for ad-hoc analysis or POC of what a scalable report will look and feel like.   
  
We  give the model access to the underlying data, business context, and conduct  a chat guided analysis and recommendations. I've noticed the output is usually easiest to manage in a PDF or even HTML for interactive functionality.

The main benefit is we get these out QUICK - like 24 hour turn around - 8 hour work day or  less.

At best we have business insights and direction for a re-usable data product at rapid speed, at worst we ""wasted"" a day going the wrong direction. Regardless we learn, we iterate, we improve - at much lower risk than building a dashboard in power BI",2

That being said, analytics is a tough field to break into at the moment. You’ll almost certainly need more than that to make a compelling case to a hiring manager that you’re worth taking a chance on. 

There’s a lot that goes into that. You can search this sub for more information on the types of hard and soft skills that you should focus on developing. You will have some work to do if you’re serious about this.

I don’t mean to be discouraging. Even in this tough market there are absolutely opportunities out there. Getting your foot in the door will probably take some time. Honestly, it may take a long time. The beginning is the hardest part. But just remember, it takes ONE company to believe in you to get that foot in.

Annotation is basically answering questions that companies already provided to machine learning algorithms, and using humans to confirm if the answer is correct in large scale. For example, confirming if the song contains a specific language or not.

If you want to draw on the experience you had with annotation and want to see how best you can make annotation questions and experiment design, then you can consider either: UX research with emphasis on survey design or data science.

To provide more context: my firm recently hued people to create AI music and engineer AI music weaved with non-AI audio to help ML models detect AI music. It’s a temporary role as the goal is to automate this process eventually (or if the talent pool is great to explore other areas).

One pattern that worked surprisingly well was annotating metrics, not dashboards. Whenever a deploy, config tweak, pricing change, or experiment ships, someone drops a short note with a date and affected metrics. Then when something moves, you search annotations instead of Slack archaeology. It does not need to be perfect, it just needs to exist.

Also worth building a habit of asking “what changed in the two weeks before this” as a default filter. Most root causes show up fast once you constrain the window. Documentation never becomes a dream state, but lightweight, mandatory breadcrumbs beat heroic debugging every time.",13

The only thing that consistently helped was forcing a lightweight habit where every meaningful change logs a short “this could move metrics X or Y” note in one place. Not Slack, not Jira comments scattered everywhere. One running changelog that analytics can reference when something looks off. It does not have to be perfect or pretty to be useful. when that does not exist, you end up doing archaeology every time.

For example, create a standardized changelog or “impact log” that’s easily accessible and consistently updated every time a new feature is launched or a configuration is changed. This log can include details like the deployment date, the team responsible, and any potential impacts on metrics. It doesn’t have to be too complex, just something simple and searchable. This could save a lot of time when you need to track down context later. Additionally, creating a regular post-launch review process where the team documents outcomes and changes might help reinforce the habit of recording relevant information. It’s not perfect, but it can definitely reduce the scrambling when things go wrong!",1
1qmzjun,7,"The root cause often is data sources themselves, changing schemas, deprecating fields, and updating APIs.

It doesn’t actually tell you why which is like 90% of what businesses actually want. Sure the number went down but WHHHHHY. was it because someone in accounting decided that all the refunds should go out exactly yesterday?


I can literally build this kind of reporting with a connector and an excel sheet and then show the boss “click button get chart” with just existing tools. It just won’t have a wrapper to let me have to blindly query for the report I think I need meanwhile I never get the context that comes with actually having to open a god damn file. 

And worst of all this assumes that the data going into isn’t a hot garbage mess. Can it contextually understand that product id in one table is the same as marketid on the other because sales decided they just haaaad to be different. Or that they just put the value amount on the line item table but uh oh it also includes the total for the order so if you add it together it is will 2x the actual number? 

Look. This might be cool for a small operation that has a small amount of data that’s easy to go clean and organize but at the same time you focused on the databases which they likely won’t have.

If you do the MSBA, make sure it is very hands-on. SQL, basic stats, and real projects matter way more than theory.

The key is what you build while studying. Projects, a portfolio, internships, freelance gigs, anything that proves you can clean data, run analyses, and tell a story with it. A lot of people pivot with a year-long MSBA, but only if they back it up with applied skills. Otherwise, it’s just a piece of paper. Tbh, entry-level analyst roles are flooded in 2026.

From my experience analyzing team coordination in high-complexity environments, I’ve seen how foundational skills can really accelerate once you're in a role where you're solving real problems, not just leveraging tools on the surface.

In my past assessments, I've observed that early roles where you're deeply involved in technical work (even if the company isn't a top brand) often lead to quicker skill growth. The reason? You're directly interacting with real-world data, dealing with messy, unpredictable challenges, and continuously improving your technical and problem-solving abilities.

That said, I think brand can still play a role, especially when it comes to networking and credibility in later stages. But early on, I would say optimizing for roles where you can focus on technical work without distraction yields the best long-term compounding effect.

1qkk3ju,4,"i do frame it less as data vs AI and more as where you will learn how work actually ships. early on roles that force you close to data quality, metrics, stakeholders, and delivery tradeoffs tend to build stronger judgment than title specific AI roles. pure AI product owner positions can be very roadmap and coordination heavy and your technical growth depends a lot on how hands on the team really is. if the analyst consulting role gives you exposure to real data problems, ambiguous requirements, and end-to-end delivery it is often easier to move into AI product work later with credibility than the other way around.",1
1qkk3ju,5,"I would look less at the job titles and more at where the learning loops actually are. Early in a role, you mostly learn from the problems you are close to and how often you have to reason about tradeoffs. A data analyst consulting role can be very technical or very shallow depending on whether you are doing real modeling, data quality work, and stakeholder problem framing, or mostly building dashboards on fixed requirements. An AI product owner role can be similarly deep or shallow depending on whether you are shaping problem definitions, constraints, and evaluation, or just translating requests between teams.

One question that often clarifies things is where you will get faster feedback on your thinking. If you want to grow technical judgment, being close to messy data, edge cases, and failure modes tends to accelerate that. If the PO role is more roadmap and coordination heavy, you might feel boxed out of that learning. On the other hand, if the AI role truly puts you in the loop on model behavior, limitations, and real world usage, that can be hard to get later. I would ask very concrete questions about what a typical week looks like in each role and what decisions you would actually own.",0

A lot of analytics roles struggle with people who can query but cannot translate, and your PM background is actually a big asset there. I have seen people make this exact shift by reframing themselves as analytics focused operators instead of ex PMs trying to escape. Bootcamps are usually overkill if you already have real SQL access experience and have built dashboards that people relied on. Roles like analytics engineer, product analytics, revenue ops, or data analyst embedded in a team might fit better than generic data scientist titles. For hiring managers, concrete examples help a lot, like what decisions changed because of your dashboards or how you validated broken data pipelines, not just that you owned them.",5

A vanilla PM role was tough for me given my analytics background and hence got into analytics PM where am actually giving requirements to the tech team to build dashboards while i am out understanding requirements of customers giving them demos, setting expectations with leadership about analytics in our product.
And the best part i like about my job is when there's this teeny tiny opportunity for me to write my own sql and create dashboards myself. I love the building part. 
And i am done with this, i do not like giving demos, making startegies (which rarely work out). I do not understand what next to do - i love building, data engineering also kind of entices me. But not sure how to make that switch. Lets see i will pivot to some more handson role after this.",2

As for the ""too late"" question - I pivoted from marketing to analytics when I was 34, enrolled in a masters program part time when I was 36, graduated when I was 39, and now I'm a data scientist at a tech company. I've been in analytics roles for close to a decade now, and probably have 20+ years until I retire, so I could probably change my career path 1-2 more times. 

Your PM experience is very beneficial - you know how to scope out projects that meet needs and make sure they are delivered. Most analytics folks struggle with that.",2

1qk0f96,2,You should get some work experience first,11
1qk0f96,3,"Yes — an MS in Data Analytics pairs really well with Accounting **if** you aim for roles like FP&A, audit analytics, risk, or finance analytics. The combo is actually a strong moat.

I’d just make sure the program is practical (SQL, BI, stats, projects), not theory-heavy. It won’t hurt future lecturing at all — if anything, it helps.",4
1qk0f96,4,"General rule of thumb is that masters degrees in this industry are only worth it if you have a hard time finding a job post-graduation or if you’re trying to pursue a career in academia/research. 

Personally, I’ve never had a difficult time finding a job so it’s not something I’ve ever considered in my case. Free time has been better spent trying to up skill to add to my tool belt so that I was able to transition away from analytics when the time was right, (I pivoted towards data engineering ~5 years after graduating)",3
1qk0f96,5,Unless your a trust fund bb that can get the masters paid for then don’t. Get the acct job and ask for sql access so you can automate your workflows.,1
1qk0f96,6,"My take as someone who went this route, earning a BS in Accounting then later getting a dual master MBA + MS in Business Analytics, I think an MS in Data Analytics can be beneficial, but only if it is aligned with a specific career direction. If it is simply because ""AI and data are becoming more popular,"" then you'd probably be better off focusing on learning specific skills, getting certifications, and working on relevant projects for a fraction of the cost of going to grad school.

The question you should ask yourself is do you want to stay in traditional accounting roles, or pivot into data analytics roles? This may not be something you can easily answer at this point without having the work experience. I spent 10 years in accounting and finance roles before getting my master's and pivoting into analytics roles.

Another question you should ask yourself is do you plan on getting your CPA license? The ROI on this will typically be greater than an MS in Data Analytics if you plan to stick with the accounting track. That's not to say that data skills don't matter, but you can learn them without going full MS.

My recommendation would be to get some work experience in accounting while doing some focused data upskilling (SQL, Python, Excel/Power Query, Power BI/Tableau). Pursue a CPA license if you plan to stay in accounting. Pursue an MS in Data Analytics if you plan to pivot into more analytics-heavy roles.",1
1qk0f96,7,"An MS DA after Accounting is useful only if it adds real technical skills you don’t already have and you actually plan to use them in a finance or accounting context. Honestly your accounting degree is already employable. The real upside is stacking analytics on top of accounting and moving into audit analytics, risk, fraud, or other data heavy finance roles. That combo is strong.

So if your undergrad didn’t cover much stats, SQL, programming, or data modeling, then a solid MS DA can be a fast track. If the program is light and mostly tool focused, it won’t carry much weight. The overlap and technical depth matter more than the degree title.

Also even one year working in an accounting or finance role where you’re using reporting or BI tools can make a grad degree way more targeted and useful. If you’d be up to read a quick guide that helps break the decision down, let me know. I can share it so you can check it out.",2
1qk0f96,8,"I believe it would. 

An accounting degree is unlikely to get you the paycheck a job with a MS in analytics would.

You’re unlocking a new field to you by having the theory under your belt. I’d pay attention to all the projects you’re likely to get involved on during your masters as they’d give you a sense of the type of problems you enjoy solving the most. ",1
1qk0f96,9,"engage in reverse interviewing, reach out to professionals who hold a job that you like and ask them how they got there and what has changed. Ask the pro and cons of each job.   
  
MS in Data analytics is changing and you may not like it. People keep talking about AI, but no one knows how it actually work, Data analytics will involve high level of math, coding, statistics, some project management and business problem resolution.   
  
It's constant evolving career that you need to be up to date with tools such as AWS, Python, SQL, Power Bi, different libraries, and that changes based on what each company needs.   
  
You will be competing with engineers who already have the mindset and tools ready from high school. If that's what you want then go for it but it will not stop by just getting Masters as DA and Data Science high paying jobs requires Phd not just masters. 

It takes 2 years to master Python by its self. Anyone saying taking certificate will cut it, they are fooling you, you will need to show your own side project and present it for reputable companies like BlackRock and TwoSigma.",0

Some tips:
- Start applying now and make an Excel sheet that tracks all your applications. This really helped me stay organized and consistent
- Network. Don’t be afraid to send messages to people who are working the same types of jobs/companies that you’d like to work in. I primarily used LinkedIn to send messages and network. 
- Reach out to recruiters. A simple message telling them about who you are, what you’re skilled at, and the types of roles that you’re interested in go a long way. 

When I was looking to break into the field of data analytics, I got my first job through a recruiter. Prior to applying I spent a few months just working on my technical skills and building projects which helped my resume look better and gave me confidence in interviews.",2
1qjyh4a,3,"Early on, signal matters more than perfection. Employers usually want to see that you can take messy data, ask the right questions, and explain outcomes clearly, not just build models. Practical projects help a lot here, especially ones that show business thinking instead of purely academic work. It also helps to learn how teams actually use analytics day to day, things like stakeholder communication, tradeoffs, and working with imperfect data. The first role is often more about proving you can be trusted with decisions than showing cutting edge techniques.",2
1qjyh4a,4,"The best thing I have noticed that helps people break into this field is connecting their existing background with data skills.

When I first started learning data, I was very unfocused because I didn’t know which area to concentrate on. There are thousands of datasets, and when I started analyzing and playing around with them, I quickly got bored.

So I asked myself, what is my background?.... So I had a bachelor’s degree in Finance. Now I realize that moving into pricing analytics, fraud analytics, or financial analysis would give me a huge advantage.

That’s exactly what I did, and that’s what I want you to do as well. If you have a degree in a specific field, start by exploring data roles related to that area. And if you don’t want to go that route, simply pick the industry that interests you the most. Period",2
1qjyh4a,5,"As someone who just landed my ""first"" data job, i think an underrated choice is not being afraid to take a stepping stone job, especially since the market isn't nice. I think you should look at career outlook long term, and get your foot in any role in an industry you'd like to work in for a while. Roles like that have the word coordinator, specialist, assistant, etc. all get less applicants and do 50%+ of analyst work. This can help the start of your career and get you thinking like an analyst. If it means anything, my first role was as a data coordinator making 45k and stayed for 1.5 years, and i have been getting multiple interviews lately ranging from 75-95k. This route also gets you to be an expert in your field, where domain matters a LOT in data roles.",2

1qjqcm6,8,"Spicy take!

I've mentored a lot of junior level analysts and the one's that struggle tend to have a hard time mentally visualizing how to transform their data from A -> B, and the steps to get there.

SQL, Python, R, PowerQuery.. whatever tool you use, are all expressions of that mental mapping into language (in this case, code).

Learning SQL or Python can help you develop this skill because you start learning the different ways data can be transformed, you encounter challenges, you learn.

Prompting an LLM requires the exact same mental mapping skills, you're just expressing it in human language rather than code.

On the other hand, being able to read code is always going to be important because it's a more efficient way to express how to transform data than English (or any other human language).

It takes like 5 hours to learn ""basic"" SQL and get going.  The advantages of that far out weighs the cost.

Edit:  It actually just reads like your company needs to build out a semantic layer.",26
1qjqcm6,9,"What are you talking about? People always say ""learn what your business uses"" not ""omg never learn anything else"". 

The reason people say to learn SQL and Python is because 

1. Sql is in damn near every business. Go scrape some data showing data analytics jobs posting and see how many mention sql. A whole damn lot. Why limit yourself when it's not even that hard to pick up? 

2. Python is everywhere. Why not learn it and maximize your skill set? 

No body is telling you that you can't have your favorite tool. But also nobody wants to hear it when you say you can't find a job and you're mad because companies x, y, and z don't use it. Just do what you want man. Long as you can learn to analyze data, pull it, and make insights who cares.

And, if I may be so bold, fixing broken scripts is fun. If you can't figure something out at least you have Claude and Gemini to help you these days. Back in the day all we had is some angry nerd on StackOverflow.",46

1qikix6,2,"this shows up a lot when teams want the behavior shift more than the title accuracy. what we keep seeing is companies rebranding bi or analytics engineer roles to push people upstream into data ownership and away from report building. the name is kind of arbitrary, the expectations are not. if you are owning transformations, models, and how datasets are consumed, you are basically an analytics engineer with extra governance responsibility. the risk is when leadership says end to end but still expects the same reporting output on top of it.",28
1qikix6,3,This is cool. Full stack means you can set things up properly and explicitly calling out data governance says this org has the right priorities.,4
1qikix6,4,"I have seen variants of this title pop up, usually when orgs are trying to change behavior faster than they can change structure. The name itself matters less than the incentives it creates. In your description, it sounds very close to analytics engineering with some governance responsibility layered in.

What I would pay attention to is not whether the title is “real,” but whether the work actually shifts away from report churn and toward owning data contracts, quality, and reuse. If that happens, the role can be a legitimate bridge toward DE. If not, it often turns into BI plus extra responsibility and fewer boundaries.

New titles like this are often signals of intent rather than clarity. The risk is not that it is fake, but that expectations stay fuzzy while scope keeps expanding.",4
1qikix6,5,"I have seen this pop up, mostly as a rebrand rather than a truly new role. It sounds very close to analytics engineer with a stronger push on governance and data products, and less tolerance for pure report building. A lot of orgs are trying to break the BI dashboard factory pattern and this is how they signal it internally. The title itself probably will not mean much outside that company, but the skills you listed are very marketable. If the actual work lines up with transformation, ownership, and reliability, the name matters less than what you can credibly say you built. I would watch closely whether they actually protect time for that work or if it slowly drifts back to report requests.",2
1qikix6,6,Sounds like governance to me,1
1qikix6,7,"I have seen variants of this show up, but usually under different names like analytics engineer or data platform analyst. The title itself feels a bit made up, but the responsibilities you described are very real and pretty common right now. A lot of teams are trying to pull BI folks out of dashboard churn and push ownership toward models, contracts, and data quality.

What matters less is whether the title is “valid” and more whether the work actually changes. If you are still judged on report output, it is just BI with a new label. If you are measured on dataset reliability, adoption, and self service success, then it is basically an analytics engineer role with a rebrand. The senior DE path only makes sense if you are actually getting reps on production grade data work, not just nicer SQL and dbt models.",1

Look at the data and make your hypothesis. Build the dashboard or visuals focusing on that specific story.

Author's rarely know how the story will end, but instead are guided by insights as their characters and narrative develop.

I think it is easy to just throw together the CSV or dashboard based on the requests from the team. Find the positives and negatives in line with the requests and that should lead you to more of the underlying conclusions.

1qhbvog,2,Completely agree. Thinking and understanding are the real tools analysts need first. Tools are pretty easy to pick up if you understand what you need from them.,6

1qhbvog,5,This is so true. Teaching critical/analytical thinking followed by execution is the hardest thing about my job as a data instructor. It requires a TON of patience.,2
1qhbvog,6,"Facts on facts. Business impact is what gets you there. 

Tools are a means to an end. The end being more money or a more efficient operation.",2
1qhbvog,7,This lines up with what we see on the ops side too. The pattern behind a lot of “advanced” analysis is that it still answers the wrong question because the framing was off. Clean logic usually shows up as pressure testing assumptions and asking what decision this will actually change. Fancy tools just make it easier to miss that if no one slows down to check. Most real value comes from noticing the same question failing across different datasets and asking why.,2
1qhbvog,8,Well said. I've met many data science graduates who are solid on their SQL and Python but aren't used to thinking about data in terms of asking the relevant business questions that will help guide the decision maker,2
1qhbvog,9,"This resonates a lot. I’ve seen people build insanely polished dashboards that answer the wrong question because nobody slowed down to sanity check assumptions. Tools just make it easier to be confidently wrong if the framing is off. The hardest part is usually translating a vague business ask into something testable and falsifiable. Once that’s clear, the Python or SQL almost feels trivial.",2
1qhbvog,10,"Strong agree with this. I have seen very polished dashboards answer the wrong question really confidently. The hardest part is usually translating a vague business concern into something the data can actually support. Tooling just makes mistakes faster if the thinking is off.

You don’t need a huge stack, just a few tools you actually use regularly: things like ChatGPT / Claude for drafting SQL, debugging code, or brainstorming analysis ideas; GitHub Copilot–style tools when you’re writing Python and doing data cleaning; PandadaAI when you want to quickly clean, explore, and visualize tabular data without getting stuck on boilerplate; and even something like Notion AI or other doc assistants to turn your analysis into a clearer narrative.

This long explanation  annoying I know. 👇🏾

Business question: Why are my customers **abandoning** their carts?

Data scientist is like a **'black box'** way of thinking. If I were to do this, I would create a pipeline to gather data from social media posts, links, ads, searches, and more. I’ll house it in a **warehouse** and then pull it to gather insights.

Based just on the **numbers**, I try to  connect the dots through user interactions: What did they click on, when, and for how long? How long did they stay on a product they bought versus one they **abandoned**?

Then, **using very little or no psychology at all,** I can identify the issue prosope solution  (This is essentially a Business Analyst’s task, but it happens.) I would design a campaign that pushes an ad, email, or text based on the products they showed the most interest in.

(There is some basic **psychology** involved, such as **pricing versus value**, but it’s mostly general.)

How do I do this with **just numbers**—without interviewing or talking to customers? One idea is to look at the average time a person spends on a product page for an item they actually **bought** versus one they **abandoned** in the cart. I  can also look into factors like price, value, or similar products. This is the baseline; next, you apply models to solve specific problems, such as matching products or calculating session times. These can be AI models.

The key is to convert human interaction into something software can capture. Unfortunately, some of these models work better in an academic setting than in real-world interactions. However, since people often exhibit similar patterns of behavior online, it can work effectively at times.   ",1
1qhb5fy,8,"I wouldn’t say it's easy, but it isn’t hard either. I do this because I’m genuinely **curious**. This stuff **influences**  everything from my clothing to my social feed—which, by the way, sucks due to the **algorithm**. I also get paid to do it, so it just so happens that I was **already** interested in it.   I have never worked for FAANG  company so I have no idea. :)  Good luck.",1

I am very interested in the world of business data analysis, which is why I applied for the EPAM Data Science Fundamentals training. And I am well-equipped with mathematical and statistical knowledge, but I had no programming knowledge when I started.

And the thing is, there were quite a lot of Python-based assignments throughout. And since the time available was short, and there was a lot of methodological and theoretical material to process, I didn't have the capacity to learn Python from scratch. So I always had AI do the coding part of the assignments, then I ran it, and based on the output, I proceeded with modeling, conclusions, etc. I usually understand what the code does, but I couldn't write it myself.

I think that by now my methodological knowledge, modeling, and Machine Learning are quite deep, and it would be good to learn the engineering part. Unfortunately, there will be a final interview, where it will definitely turn out that I'm not capable of this, so they probably won't give me a certificate. However, this will mean that I will lose the opportunity to continue to the next, Advanced level, where I could develop further with a kind of mentorship.

My question is, can you recommend a direction or place where I could continue? Where I could gain practice in actual business environment, where they would be open to mentor someone like me, who is very behind in the programming part, but otherwise I would be completely open to development and learning in this, in exchange for having a deep methodological knowledge?",2

Creating dashboards and decks to show a clients discovered trends found in raw or underdeveloped data.  Is there a course I can take to see how big the gap is?

1qh82jp,6,"Hi ,

I’m currently transitioning into Data Analytics and aiming for remote junior roles. My background is in healthcare , and I’ve always worked closely with data - patient flow, case research, clinical studies, procedures, revenue tracking, scheduling, and basic reporting.

I’m also planning to move to another country, so I’m trying to build a skill set that works well remotely.

Right now I’m doing the Google Data Analytics Certificate and practicing SQL, Excel, and some Python through hands-on projects, but I’m still unsure about the most efficient path forward.

From your experience:  
What should a beginner prioritize today?  
Is it better to focus on strong portfolio projects, certifications, Kaggle, freelancing, or networking?  
And if you were starting from a healthcare background, what would you build in the first 3–6 months?

I’d really appreciate any real-world advice from people already working in analytics. Thanks!",1

For example, product analysts sometimes transition into product management or product operations, while enterprise or BI analysts can move into strategy, operations, or program management roles.

Experience always trumps projects, especially when that experience is in the exact industry you’re applying to.

Recruiters are not spending time reviewing portfolios, even for entry level roles. Given how oversaturated the market is and how stretched thin recruiters are, they rely primarily on resumes, titles, and company names to filter candidates.

Hiring managers are busy managing teams, running interviews, and conducting technical or case interviews. They are not digging through personal projects on top of all that.

If you already have four years of relevant industry experience, you don’t need portfolio projects. What you should be focusing on instead is how you’re positioning yourself on your resume for the roles you’re applying to, along with things like networking.

Most organizations do need reporting specialists, because management does know what they want to look at. It is very rare, that you do an exploratory analysis and it is being used after. I have been in the industry for 8 years.

Doing reporting is not trivial at all, because you need to know data modelling, pipelines, different tools, query optimization, visualization, access control and a lot more. And this is what management doesn't know. Everyone has a hunch of which customers make us the most money or so. They often just need confirmation.",46
1qg9me7,3,"A lot of this argument assumes that “real analysis” = “college statistics exam"", but that’s a pretty narrow slice of what analysts actually do in the real world

My own team doesn’t do a ton of formal analytics yet; we’re actively building toward it, myself included. But that doesn’t mean the work is shallow or non‑analytical. Our day‑to‑day sits at the intersection of:

- ETL and data hygiene
- Process automation
- Complex SQL logic and data modeling
- Low‑level forecasting and internal models
- Business‑rule translation
- Light scripting/OOP to support workflows
- BI ecosystems that aren’t just “dashboards"", but interconnected reporting layers

And those dashboards aren’t just pretty charts. We build department and sub‑department reporting that supports:

- Nuanced drill‑downs for people who need to get into the weeds
- Simple drill‑ups for executives who want the high‑level story
- Cross‑linked views that let users move between related metrics without losing context

Designing that kind of system requires analytical thinking, domain understanding, and a lot of reasoning about data lineage, metric definitions, and how people actually make decisions

On top of that, we analyze the business impact and ROI of the patterns we surface. We tie those insights directly to the reporting we build and document how those observations influenced actual decisions. That’s not “report building.” That’s closing the loop between data, insight, and action

Reducing SQL + BI to “just report building” ignores how much logic design, validation, and problem‑solving goes into making something that reflects business reality. That is analysis; it’s just not the academic flavor

If someone’s entire job is clicking buttons in Power BI, sure, that’s not an analyst.  
But someone who owns pipelines, transformations, modeling, logic design, and reporting?  
That’s absolutely an analyst. Just a different specialization than the stats‑heavy path

The field is broad. Pretending only one branch counts doesn’t make the others less legitimate; it just ignores how analytics has evolved

Literally I work in a government organisation lined up to the rafters with fuckwits like this, who go under the title of ""analyst"". The money some people get paid to "" do meetings"", delegate or cobble an Excel spreadsheet together and write a paragraph in word is frightening.

What matters more is whether you can demonstrate SQL, Excel, Python, or dashboarding with real problems, even if those come from side projects or self driven analysis. Plenty of people break into data analyst roles from ops, support, or KPO type jobs by reframing their experience and proving skills, so focus less on the title and more on building evidence that you can actually do the job.",1
1qdfn9v,5,"It’s definitely possible to make the switch from a KPO Analyst to a Data Analyst, but it will require some intentional effort to bridge the gap. While your current role may not involve data analysis directly, you can still leverage your existing skills to your advantage.

The key will be to highlight transferable skills from your KPO role. For example, your work on ads curation likely involved data-driven decision-making, handling large sets of data, or even working with basic data tools or reporting. These are all valuable skills that can be applied in a Data Analyst role, even if you haven't been formally doing analysis.

What you’ll want to focus on is upskilling yourself in areas that are specific to data analysis, like learning SQL, Python, Excel (if you aren’t already proficient), and gaining a deeper understanding of statistical methods and data visualization. If you can demonstrate that you've been actively learning and applying these skills, you’ll be in a much stronger position.

Also, don’t be discouraged by the fact that your current role isn’t directly related to data analysis. It can still be counted as experience, especially if you frame it in a way that highlights how you’ve interacted with data and the analytical thinking you've applied.

Finally, networking is huge! Reach out to people in data analysis roles, either through LinkedIn or forums like this, and ask for advice on how they made the transition. It might also be worth looking into entry-level data analyst roles or internships to get your foot in the door, even if they’re a bit lower-paying initially.

Good luck! The fact that you’re eager to get back into data analysis shows that you’re already on the right track.",-1

1qd8sq8,2,"The problem you’re describing is usually solved with Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM).

At a high level, MMM models sales as baseline demand (trend, seasonality etc) plus incremental demand driven by advertising spend.

MMM estimates these together, typically using regression. Advertising spend enters the model as external variables that are lagged to reflect delayed impact (adstock), and show diminishing returns as spend increases (saturation).

In practice this is usually done at a higher aggregation level (for example brand or category), with results allocated down to items afterwards. This keeps the model stable, usually there is too much noise at SKU level.

The output can then be used for forecasting under different spend scenarios, which is difficult to do cleanly with ETS in Excel. Generally speaking you would do MMM in statistical software (e.g. Python/R).",5
1qd8sq8,3,"I’ve seen this go sideways when people try to force spend directly into a time series that was never built for it.

Forecast organic or baseline units with ETS, then layer a separate response model for paid that estimates incremental lift by brand or category, not SKU. Even coarse spend buckets or on off regimes can be more stable than continuous coefficients. Trying to do this at 300 item granularity will almost always overfit unless budgets are very consistent. At some point this does get easier in dedicated tools, but the conceptual split matters more than the software.",1
1qd8sq8,4,"Most Reddit analysts don’t do this kind of forecasting, but it’s what I’ve been doing for years. It’s uncomfortable because it’s not an MMM-style regression model. You’re building an outcome by applying multipliers to a baseline.

The key is to start with your priors, then layer in assumptions. For example: if you expect inflation to rise 5%, you might assume CPCs rise 5% too—which would reduce projected ROAS.

For a unit forecast, the framework is straightforward (just time-consuming and math-heavy). Unit sales are a function of:

Spend

* Cost per site visit (or CPC/CPV)
* Site conversion rate (CVR)
* Average order value (AOV)

You should have all of these in historical data. Start with baseline spend, apply year-over-year budget changes, then extrapolate the other metrics using your assumptions (costs, CVR, AOV, etc.). Whether you build it monthly, weekly, or annually, you can get to a defensible projection. My templates tend to be large because each step builds on the previous one.

I’m guessing you’re being asked to do the first step of this broader exercise. As you build it, use algebra to “templatize” the forecast: keep every assumption (your coefficients/weights) in a clearly labeled section so you can duplicate a tab, update assumptions, and compare scenarios cleanly.

You’ll also want a few inputs if you don’t already have them—especially the client’s strategic goal (e.g., YOY growth, improved efficiency, budget cuts, break-even ROAS). Common follow-up questions are:

* “How much more budget do we need to hit our target?”
* “How much do we need to cut to reach break-even ROAS?”

Make the template readable and flexible. You’ll likely need to walk someone through it and defend it. The upside is that by then, you’ll know the data cold.

Zooming out: this kind of forecasting is hard for a lot of analysts because it’s not just math. It requires judgment, business context, and lots of iteration. But it’s how finance teams work. They’re using forecasts as health benchmarks (traffic, units, revenue impact), not as efficiency-optimized models. It can be an uncomfortable space—but it can also be a valuable skill set.

One last point: building a defensible forecast takes real time. In many of the businesses I’ve worked on, it’s easily 2–4 weeks of effort—setting up templates, gathering data, collecting assumptions, iterating, validating, and packaging the final output.",1
1qd8sq8,5,"Needing to account for marketing activity increases the complexity of this exercise by like a thousand x and this is an incredibly difficult open problem -- media mix modeling is very much not solved and large CPG companies will employ teams of 10+ statistics PhDs to work on this problem for them. So make sure you're setting expectations internally correctly!

Whatever path you go down, I'd start by building a backtesting framework that will allow you to check the forecast accuracy of your model at points in time in the past. So you should be able to answer a question like ""if I had run this model 3 months ago and made a prediction, how accurate would that forecast have been?"".

Once you have a good backtesting framework you'll be in a much better position to judge what other types of technologies (like different flavors of MMMs) may or may not help you.",1

1qd0f6g,2,"this reads like imposter syndrome wayyy before u admit it, but it’s really “no spec + no ownership.” when direction is vague, the move isn’t asking more, it’s forcing clarity: ask questions that have 2 possible answers, state ur assumption, and give a deadline (“i’m proceeding with A unless u tell me B by EOD”). then u’re not guessing in silence, u’re documenting. if they still don’t respond, that’s a process problem u can point to, not a u problem.

also remember that there are no dumb questions, its mostly how u ask them and at what point that u do, and how do u set boundaries.

good luck man ive been there !!",9
1qd0f6g,3,"This is unfortunately isn’t uncommon in analytics roles where documentation can at times be quite weak and expectations live in people’s heads.

A couple of questions first. 

How big is the team you’re on, and do you have coworkers you can lean on? 

A lot of people cope with unclear managers by sanity checking things with coworkers instead. It’s not ideal, but it’s often the fastest way to understand how things have historically been done and which sources, models, and definitions are considered trusted.

Another approach that helps, and another commenter highlight this already, is shifting from open ended questions to validation. 

Rather than building something new from scratch, start by finding what already exists. 

Look at prior reports, dashboards, tables, models, or queries, etc. and try to understand which ones have been used as the source of truth and how metrics have been derived.

Then bring those concrete artifacts to your manager and ask very specific questions like:

- “Is this the model that feeds this KPI?”
- “Is this table or model the source of truth for this metric?”
- “Is this transformation logic still valid, or has the definition changed?”
- “Is this how we calculate this metric?”

Yes or no questions like these are much harder to dodge and help prevent rework.

If nothing exists or you’re explicitly told to create something new, document your assumptions up front and ask for confirmation before proceeding. If those assumptions later turn out to be wrong, that’s not a failure on your part. You surfaced the uncertainty and asked for alignment.

Also, asking questions does not make you look incompetent. 

Silent confusion is far riskier than visible clarification, especially early in a role. 

Ambiguity is a permanent part of analytics work, not a sign that you don’t belong.

Imposter syndrome shows up a lot in environments like this, and it usually reflects underdeveloped systems, not personal inadequacy. 

Focus on reducing ambiguity where you can, documenting what you learn, and getting alignment in writing when possible.

Feeling lost at times is normal in analytics. 

The goal isn’t to eliminate ambiguity, it’s to learn how to operate within it without burning yourself out.",2

* Defining the hypothesis (what behavior you expect to change and why).
* Choose the success metric (conversions, activation, retention, revenue per user etc.).
* Split traffic (50/50 or weighted) and let it run until you have enough data.

For the tooling side here's what I'd recommend from personal experience:

* For product experiments teams I know use LaunchDarkly or internal feature-flag systems.
* For marketing/landing page tests we use tools like Optibase, which handles the traffic split and tracking, then we pull the data into analytics to validate impact.

If you want hands-on experience I'd recommend running a real test on a personal site or project with defined metrics.

1qcrbuz,3,"Mixpanel/Amplitude end up being “the product analytics team in a box” for anyone who doesn’t have a full data org yet, and that’s the real takeaway here.

I’ve seen them used most heavily by \~5–200 person SaaS teams where PMs and growth folks need answers without begging data engineering. Typical workflows: weekly activation/retention reviews, quick funnels for new features, cohorting by plan or segment, and validating experiments before they get full engineering buy‑in. In very early-stage, they’re usually wired just enough to track activation and a couple of core loops; in mid-size teams they become the default place PMs live day to day. At true enterprise scale, they’re often a layer on top of a warehouse, not the single source of truth.

For monitoring Reddit chatter about Mixpanel/Amplitude changes or bugs, I’ve seen people lean on Sprout and Brandwatch, but Pulse for Reddit stands out when you want actual thread-level context instead of just volume charts.

I spent hours with customer support and had to write JavaScript to manipulate data….wut?

Some of broader company data was in SQL, but not our team…they put it into elastic search… so I made a python notebook instead to pull from both and use plotly to make the charts. I think that problem was unique to this company and what the team was building though. After I made the notebook I stopped using Mixpanel.

And my current company with 250 people didn’t have Mixpanel for a long time but our new CPO demanded we have it a few years ago and analytics was responsible for pushing adoption amongst product managers and others. Pretty much only one PM used it, the CPO left last year and we’re trying to cancel the contract.",1

1qc96mo,2,"Hey there, not in that position, but if I were, I would get to know the members of the team or teams you’re supporting. Once I build the connection, I would hope that I build the rapport with them so my name pops up from time to time until I CC’d as well into the conversations or meeting requests. This would be my Hail Mary if I liked the company and all. If I didn’t like the company, team, etc, then I would honestly keep my head down, get paid, and start applying elsewhere.",25
1qc96mo,3,"I’ve seen this happen when a team really just wants a reliable query runner and slapped a senior title on it for hiring reasons. You can still get value out of it, but you have to manufacture it yourself. I’d start treating the extracts as inputs for your own analysis. Track common requests, look for patterns, and proactively send short notes like “I keep seeing X trend in these pulls, might be worth digging into.” Even if they ignore half of it, you build reps and artifacts. Worst case, you end up with a clean portfolio of analyses you did quietly. Best case, someone realizes they are underusing you and pulls you into more interesting work.",19
1qc96mo,4,"havent been in your shoes, but geeze differences between companies are wild  
  
I was at an org as a project assistant right out of college and ended up doing a ton of the ETL, SQL, report building, alerts, dashboards, and more because they didn't have anyone else who could and they were trying to modernize to a new system. not even like I knew it all, I was just cheap and willing to self teach.   


is the pay good? maybe just start pushing for access to better tools and more data so you can answer any odd question or theories they have. but if they're already all set in how they operate then I'm not sure how much wiggle room you have. you need them to ""need"" something, so you can build it for them. if you can identify gaps or easier ways for them to get answers, then you could make the case that you need them to give you access to X tool and Y data sets, so you can build the new and improved solution for them.",4
1qc96mo,5,"I have seen this happen when “senior” really means trusted SQL throughput instead of business ownership. If you are not careful, it can quietly deskill you on the parts that actually drive senior growth.

If quitting is not on the table yet, I would try to treat the extraction work as leverage. Look for patterns in requests and proactively package them into reusable datasets, views, or metrics, then socialize those with your manager as efficiency wins. That is often the only way to create space for higher level work in a team that defaults to ticket pulling.

At the same time, be honest with yourself about the risk. If months have passed and nothing changed after asking directly, this role may not evolve. You can still get value by sharpening data modeling, speed, and reliability, but I would keep an exit plan in mind so you do not wake up a year later feeling even further from the work you actually want to be doing.",4

Sometimes that’s the only way to reopen the door to analysis without formal meetings. Another thing to watch is whether this setup is intentional or just immature, because those lead to very different timelines for change.

Skip another degree or big bootcamp. Instead, turn your current job into your portfolio factory: build 3–5 concrete marketing analytics projects from real or realistic data:

\- Channel performance dashboard (organic vs paid, CAC, ROAS)

\- Cohort analysis on leads from different campaigns

\- Funnel drop-off and A/B test reporting

Document: the question, the data, your SQL/Excel steps, and how it changed a decision.



Target titles like marketing data analyst, growth analyst, CRM analyst, revenue ops analyst, digital analytics specialist. Those folks care that you speak “client + campaign” more than pure math.



On the tools side, think Mixpanel/GA4/Looker Studio for tracking funnels; I’ve used Sprout and HubSpot for reporting, and Pulse plus similar tools mainly to monitor and join niche Reddit convos around analytics and martech problems.

Neverfear to ask for help…,82
1qc6u9p,3,"Day 2 is too early to feel like you are behind. I would say give yourself at least 3 months until you start to understand how you stack up. 

I have a masters in business intelligence and analytics and I have had three promotions since I started 5 years ago, doubling my salary. I felt the same way as you when I started. I am working towards another promotion now and I still feel the same way. 

Imposter syndrome is like body dysmorphia - it doesn't matter how much weight you lose, you will still feel disgusted whenever you look in the mirror. 

Anyways, I hope you find peace. Give it time and don't ask yourself if you are doing a good job, instead ask yourself if you are happy. If the answer is yes, then keep doing it. If not, then stop. And if you figure out how to cure imposter syndrome, please let me know =]",16

1qc6u9p,7,"First of all imposter syndrome is normal and actually a good thing. I still feel imposter syndrome after 8 years in the field. It’s people that don’t feel imposter syndrome that think they know more than they actually do and make mistakes.

Second, it sounds like you were upfront about your skills and knowledge. If they hired you then they don’t expect or shouldn’t expect you to be able to master any of that in a short amount of time. It’s also very normal to feel overwhelmed especially in the beginning. Do you have any mentors or more senior people that can help support you? Don’t be afraid to ask questions more than once. 

Third, take a deep breath and try to relax. Anxiety is normal and it’s important to try to have healthy ways to relieve it. Exercise and or going for walks outside can really help me with anxiety. Being around friends and family after work and even therapy are important.",3
1qc6u9p,8,"Many moons ago I was internally hired as a data analyst from an operations role. I had no real SQL experience, but I had worked a lot alongside the data analytics team and they thought I’d fit in.

I felt everything you’re feeling now. I’m living proof that you can figure all of this out. In no time at all you’ll have some experience under your belt and you’ll become one of the super intelligent people new hires look up to.

I'm stoked, because I want to suffer, because with suffering comes learning.",3
1qc6u9p,10,"This sounds incredibly rough, but what you are describing is way more common than people admit, especially in the first few weeks. Being overwhelmed does not mean you made the wrong choice, it usually means the ramp-up is poorly structured. Replacing someone who held a lot of institutional knowledge is hard for anyone, even experienced analysts. Feeling lost on day two is not a signal that you are failing.

Imposter syndrome hits hardest when you are surrounded by smart people, and that usually means you are in the right room. They hired you knowing your background and gaps, and they still chose you. That matters more than how confident you feel right now. Sleep deprivation will also make everything feel ten times worse, so try to be kind to yourself on that front.

It does get better, but not overnight. The learning curve is steep, then it flattens. Focus on understanding one small thing at a time and ask questions early, even if they feel basic. Most teams would rather explain something twice than have someone silently struggle. If expectations feel misaligned with the role, it is also okay to ask your manager how they see the ramp over the next few months.

You are not dumb. You are new, tired, and under pressure. That combination would shake almost anyone.",3

1. Look for local, in office, low paying roles.   You need to seek out roles that receive less competition and have less requirements and are from companies that can't afford top talent.

2. Develop work experience in a role related to the industry you want to work in.  You want to end up in marketing analytics?  Find a job in marketing that uses data.  What a role in sales analytics?  Learn sales.

3. Develop your own skills.  Asking for guidance is fine, but there are thousands of data tools and many ways to analyze data.  You can't prepare for all of them, but you will need to learn how to learn on the go.

4. Core skills as you should already know: SQL, Excel, Visualization tool (Tableau/Power BI).

There are also hundreds of these posts about recommendations on how to start.  Starting without a degree will just be more difficult due to competition.  So you can just read all of those posts to collect data on what to do.  It's all repetitive anyways.

While minor business have one to none in the people analytics role, meaning that one person is doing a little of everything: business analytics, software engineering, data engineering, data science, reporting and researching.

The percentage of each task done depends exclusively of the maturity of the people analytics area. If is new in the business most will be software and data engineering, must build the information systems. But if the area has been growing some time, reporting will be popping off.

Major business probably have the data well organized and running smooth so data science and business analytics are the players here since the other tasks may be outsourced to backend or services.

Technical skills depends of the maturity of the business area, but being able to understand the business is key, how and why decisions are made and why data is important to be consistent through time.

What you are describing is basic critical thinking skills (which unfortunately is getting less and less prevalent), but in a niche field.",22

“Why is this metric dropping? Sales are up, but revenue is down, why?”



A few hours later, you’ll find yourself stress-testing the data and pulling out real insights.



Then ask: what do the KOLs actually care about here?



Pick three questions that really matter to them and to the business, and answer those. If you bring more than three, you’ll lose the room and their attention.",13
1qbnnnj,5,"Have been a hiring manager & hiring manager's-manager for dozens of analysts, and then have project managed dozens more.

My experience is that:

- insight has a very substantially innnate component to it--some people are just good at it, and others aren't, and you can tell pretty quickly when you've got someone in one of the tails of the distribution on your hands, but also

- People CAN get better at it, and that while it tends to happen organically with experience, giving a shit and paying attention / having a framework for asking yourself the right questions seems to speed up the process

Because of that, over the years my team has tilted more and more towards hiring for insight / 'this person gets it' vs technical skill, because I can usually train people up enough for our purposes on SQL / stats / process stuff much faster than I can get someone to get it.

In terms of things that I often tell more junior folks whose challenge is with the judgement / insights side of the job, there's a couple things that come up somewhat frequently:

- Experience = time x attention. Whenever you get a question about something from your boss, a stakeholder, etc, *that is feedback*.  Whenever one of your peers is presenting something & you're in the position to observe, put yourself in the stakeholders shoes and actively try to understand their work from their perspective--what about what they're doing is helpful, what's confusing? When a stakeholder gets confused about stuff, can you spot where your colleague went wrong? What information would you have needed to know to arrive at the insightful observation that someone else had, and how do you get that information?

- Analytics people tend to (in my experience) way overweight the importance of statistical significance (and related concepts), as compared to magnitudes. If its hard to tell if an effect is real or noise, unless you've really fucked up analytically or have way too little data, the real answer is ""this doesn't matter very much"".

- Thinking abou the relationships between numbers is often super helpful. A scenario I run into with bad-judgement junior analysts a lot is where we'll have 3 metrics that we measure on an experiment, and maybe one of them is stat-sig positive, and the others have no stat sig change.  But often, there's a definitional relationship between the three metrics. Trivial example, but e.g. ""I measured ad impressions, CTRs, and ad clicks. Ad impressions are up, stat sig, but we detect no change to CTRs or ad clicks.""  In that situation, you can go one level deeper than what the stat-sig numbers strictly tell you--if you think that impressions are up, EITHER CTRs are flag-to-up, in which case clicks are up, too, OR clicks are flat to down because CTRs moved in a countervailing direction. If you're seeing that CTRs are directionally down, and clicks looks quite flat, its often helpful to stakeholders / your own understanding to reason through that logic chain and say ""hey impressions is definitely up, but it LOOKS like CTRs moved in the opposite direction and counteracted the movement. Is that plausible / a thing we see very often?"" and the answer to that question is ""oh yeah, this is a thing I've seen a TON of times on more-powered experiments--usually, when you increase impressions, the CTR tends to go down in response because the maginal thing is worse than the average"". 

- ""What else would happen if this hypothesis was true?"" is a super useful question, and one you should find ways to ask yourself in a structured way. Pretty often you can get yourself to something like ""hey this change might be caused by X. If that was true, I would see ABC among this subpopulation. Is that true?""  E.g., we often measure account retention and revenue retention, and the 'normal' thing is that they move together, but reasonably often they don't. Good-insight people can spot that divergence when it happens and realize ""hey this is totally plausible, but not NORMAL--I should figure out which of the ~3 ways this can happen is driving it"". Then you can quickly go check on the possible answers ('we're disproportionately losing big/small spenders' or 'people who retain are changing how much they spend at unexpected rates' are basically the two possible answers).  Notably, this loops back to the first thing--to do this, you have to KNOW what the 'expected' result is, and then also know 'hey when this has been weird before, A, B and C have been the answers'.  You can either wait to get fucked over by A, B and C YOURSELF, and then learn that way, OR you can be more observant about analysis going on around you.  The second way is much faster :D",8
1qbnnnj,6,Business understanding usually gets you good results,3
1qbnnnj,7,"Download mba consulting case studies. There are hundreds of them online. Most are around growth strategy, pricing strategy market entry, profitability and mergers & acquisitions. You will be presented with some data and a problem (not problem statement), you need to define a problem statement, come up with a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, create a story (Minto pyramid, scqa) and provide a recommendation. It requires structural thinking, in some ways it's a hard skill rather than a soft skill. It requires practice, lots of practice. Good luck.",3
1qbnnnj,8,"I'd say it's about the thorough experience and expertise of your industry (like, knowing it inside-out, working in the field in different positions, working cases, learning from other colleagues and experts, taking university courses etc). Then it's about critical thinking and metacognition (sort of ""thinking about thinking"", cognitive biases and whatnot). Lastly, you need creativity that goes beyond the data, helps in brainstorming and building hypotheses/scenarios. Just kinda let your mind wander in productive and controlled way. 

As a person who got into work with data only as a ""secondary""  specialization, after I gained the primary expertise in other domain, my technical prowess never was top-notch like people who did MA in Data Science. There is stuff I'm not technically able to do. But I knew the industry well, which helped a great deal. It was easier to learn SQL and use it as a tool for advancing knowledge about that industry. It never really was about being just the expert in SQL and nothing else. I also had colleagues who were technically very competent, but struggled to generate insights and ask the right questions, because they didn't really bother with in-depth learning about the industry - they mostly just lacked curiosity, nor they were much interested in thought processes and advancing the non-technical part.",2
1qbnnnj,9,"No software not technical advancement will solve critical thinking and domain expertise. Even tools that have extremely advanced narratives and generated insights (annie pandasai, narrative bi etc) can only be supporters. The more you know the business domain, the better will be your insights. This cannot be delegated 100% to technology. So yes, you can train yourself by gaining vertical domain expertise and critical thinking upskilling",2
1qbnnnj,10,"I think you’re circling something important, and the fact that you can articulate the gap so clearly already puts you closer to insight than you might think. What you’re noticing isn’t really about technical skill versus talent. It’s about where attention is directed.

In my experience, analytical insight is much less about cleverness and much more about problem framing under constraint. People who consistently “see” the right thing tend to spend more time understanding the decision context, what is actually at stake, what can realistically change, and what tradeoffs are acceptable. They’re often optimizing for usefulness, not correctness. That’s why simpler analyses land harder.

Insight can be trained, but not in the same way technical skills are. It’s cultivated through feedback loops that tie your analysis to outcomes. When you see how decisions actually play out, where leaders ignore your work, misinterpret it, or act on something else entirely, you start adjusting how you ask questions. That learning rarely happens in isolation at a keyboard.

One practical exercise that helps is postmortems on your own analyses. Not whether they were accurate, but whether they changed anything. What question did the decision maker really have? What constraint did you miss? Over time, that builds pattern recognition that looks like foresight from the outside.

Aggregation occurs when we summarize data along different dimensions to create contextually relevant chunks that are easier to understand. For instance, summarizing all product category sales as total sales.

You don't really ""de-aggregate"". Instead, you go back to your source data, where granularity is very fine (there exist detailed descriptive labels for logical groupings) and bring in those dimensions as their individual threads.

You aggregate data when you sum up 31 days into a month. You aggregate data when you say you have 3 pets, instead of a cat, a dog, and a lizard. You aggregate data when you summarize NPS scores as deractors and advocates rather than individual ratings between 1 and 10.",1

1. Communication: not everyone needs to know everything at all times but having a record of relevant issues and team/sister team’s goings on is extremely helpful in critical moments or to forestall major issues. Clear communication of expectations/objectives/priorities is also extremely important, and in this you need to tailor level of detail to the situation and report. Go into as much detail on each of these topics as each person needs. Someone more senior may just need a general guideline on focuses and flexibilities. Someone more junior may need specific tasks and explanations on how these affect the company. In this we also see flexibility and willingness to tailor messages as very important. 

2. This will differ for different levels and situations. Juniors/new people you may want to handhold and teach them what is expected in work products and clear results you want. This should also apply to people you think are not performing and you should also clearly communicate when you feel this is happening.  No one wants more micromanagement but when it’s necessary you should make it clear why and how you are going to be involved. Leadership should generally get more involved when you’re mentoring, guiding a career, or speaking in a larger forum on someone’s behalf. Leadership should back off when it comes to the minutiae or a task or project except as necessary to gather information, answer questions, or to re-align expectations. 


3. Good leadership protects always but keeps aware of what their team is up to so that they can know when to let the filter slip on passion projects or personal promises. Correct when necessary and be open about it and why. Last minute requests are sometimes necessary but don’t make it a habit if possible. If your work environment just forces it then communicate that.

4. Sadly, likeability and experience(hard to fulfill otherwise), on both sides. If you have been in their shoes before, rising up the ranks the same way doing similar projects, they will trust your judgment more often. If you made a decision that benefitted them somehow or even just supported their career in a tangible way(promotion, salary, etc.) they will tend to stick with and be loyal to you/your decisions more. If you are likeable and down to earth your reports will like you more. Hard to teach likeability or trust. 

5. Where to begin lol. Everything. You need to take time to actually understand what people are doing, at the level that is appropriate for your position and the level appropriate for the project you are working.  Everything can be misunderstood; communicate clearly, be prepared to course correct or realign as necessary.",6

* He was very strategic, only focused on problems that would turn out results.

There's a lot of feature-engineering going on in my day-to-day, and I sometimes have to use Python (just a preference). You build your own dashboards as well to look for weird patterns and anomalies, and create triggers or features for that again.

It's high-stakes, but a very (relatively) fun job for me as someone who grew up with love for puzzles. A lot of times, you have to look for creative ways to fill in the gaps for the features you want to explore (ex: you want to get the distance between client's coordinates and the shop's, except that you don't have the data for the shop's coordinates, so you have to find a way to derive the coordinates on your own).

It's a lot and very high-pressure since the company is continuously losing money from fraud. 

As for online resources, fraud analysis is very closely related to risk analysis. There's a lot of online courses on Credit Risk Modeling (I just enrolled), while fraud analysis is best learned on the job.",1

Senior analysts usually spend less time building dashboards and more time defining metrics, pushing back on vague requests, and explaining tradeoffs to stakeholders. That is a business skill more than a technical one. If you can say why a metric matters, what behavior it drives, and what decision should change based on it, people notice.

Basic experimentation and causal thinking are useful, even if you never run full A/B tests. Understanding bias, confidence, and when not to trust data goes a long way. You do not need a master’s for that. Self study plus finding ways to apply it at work is usually enough.

If analytics engineer interests you, learning data modeling, metric layers, and how downstream reporting breaks when upstream contracts are sloppy is very valuable.

Stats helps, but mostly in understanding causality, experiments, and when data is lying to you, not advanced math. You do not need a masters to get there if you can start influencing how analysis is used and trusted. Senior analysts are often valued because leaders rely on their judgment, not because they know one more function in SQL.",1
1qavtfq,10,"Feeling stuck at this stage is usually a signal that your role is scoped around reporting, not decision-making, and progression comes from shifting that balance rather than becoming more technical. Senior analysts add value by framing problems, challenging assumptions, and influencing what the business does next, not by building more dashboards. Statistics helps, but only at an applied level: understanding experimentation, causality, and common pitfalls well enough to guide decisions and push back on bad interpretations. You don’t need a master’s degree; you need opportunities to own ambiguous questions, propose analyses proactively, and tie insights to outcomes.

1q9dpop,2,"In my experience, those case studies are less about perfect answers and more about how you think and communicate. They often want to see how you frame the problem, decide what data matters, and explain tradeoffs to a non technical audience. Since you already passed SQL, I would focus on metrics selection, assumptions, and how you would validate or challenge the data. Practicing walking through your thought process out loud helps a lot. It also helps to be clear about what you would ask for if the data is incomplete, that shows good real world judgment.",2
1q9dpop,3,"Congrats on clearing the SQL screen; for a case study they’ll usually care more about how you scope the problem and explain tradeoffs. I tend to open by restating the goal, naming the primary metric and guardrails, then outline a simple plan: data needed, quick checks, and the likely visuals. Practicing a couple prompts from the IQB interview question bank out loud helps me keep answers tight. I’d do one timed dry run with Beyz coding assistant to simulate pressure, and talk through a funnel analysis plus when I’d recommend an A/B test. Keep stories in a loose STAR structure and aim for 60 to 90 second chunks so you don’t ramble. That prep usually lands well.",2

1q9a862,2,The main benefit to attending a graduate program is the school's network. They have a vested interest in trying to get you employed after you graduate.

1q9a862,3,"First let's acknowledge the elephant in the room, your status.  I've been in tech for a long time and this is probably the worst time for international applicants in at least 20 years. Companies are super reluctant now to hire anyone who isn't a citizen or a permanent resident. Even though an F1 Visa really wouldn't be taxing on the company, they still are more reluctant.

Now that we've acknowledged why it's so much harder for you, here's what you can do. 

When people say apply early the best way to do that is to apply directly on the company's website. Even if you find the listing on LinkedIn you are much much much better off going to that company's website and applying their directly. 

Additionally, you should be able to find a few companies that hire a lot of people in the field that you are in. For those companies you want to not just apply on their website, you want to check their website regularly for new listings. 

The more you want to come work for the company the more frequently you should check. Since I was focusing in the health insurance space I typically checked three or four companies websites every day or every other day. 

Most of the time there will be nothing there and I will seem like a waste. But every once in awhile you'll find the listing for something that was just put on the side a few hours earlier.  Keep in mind that in most places they will list something on their own website days before listing it on LinkedIn. 

You have a power bi certification, which is good. You may want to pick up the tableau certification also. While tableau is definitely fallen over the past 5 years, there's still a decent number of places that use tableau.  That would keep your bases covered. 

When you say that you aren't getting past the first round in your interviews, tell me what that first round is? Is this the first round with the HR recruiter? Depending on where you are being blocked in the whole hiring funnel (which is just like a sales funnel) that will tell you what things you need to adjust.",10

I started out at a marketing agency as a digital account manager and saw a great need for analytics and reporting support for their clients.

That got me invited to a data analyst junior role (hourly role).  From there automated their internal reporting ecosystem and explanded analytical capabilities of the org every year for 6 years, adding more responsibilities and skill sets.

Then transitioned to Progressive Insurance as a lateral role change doing internal reporting for their large account sales team.  4 years into that role.

Each year upskilled, built meaningful tools and analysis projects.  Probably have completed around 2600+ separate data analysis projects over that time.

But for a lot of it I was grossly underpaid and burned out until I got to Progressive.

So if you lack the degree (like me), you need extensive work experience and be prepared for less money than you think.  Juniors do not make 6 figures starting and if they do its the top tier talent at the best employers.  I didnt breach $100k until 2023 after 7-8 years of grinding.",1

It’s always been the case that knowing technical skills alone isn’t enough to be a data analyst. Anyone can learn technical skills. Having business knowledge and being able to solve problems that matter has always been the key to getting and keeping a job. This isn’t new and won’t change. 

However, we’re collecting and using more data than ever and having bad or inaccessible data will make things even harder especially as we try to automate more - so data engineering will also continue to be important, but that’s a separate job and skill set altogether.",29

Pure technical depth will always matter, but it is becoming easier to rent or abstract away. What is harder to automate is knowing which questions are worth answering, when the data is misleading, and how much confidence is enough to move. That usually comes from understanding how the business actually operates and what tradeoffs leaders are making.

That said, leaning only into “business” without staying grounded in data tends to drift into opinion and narrative. The people who seem to have the most leverage are the ones who can translate messy reality into something decision makers can act on, and also push back when the numbers are being overinterpreted. It is less about picking a side and more about owning the interface between the two.",4
1q8v3zr,7,"I have the same hunch as you. The combo of both some tech + some business acumen is not going to be around much longer. Business folks will be able to get their tool usage sorted via AI. You either need to pivot to hardcore data engineering or pure business (MBA style).

1q8v3zr,8,"I don’t think the future splits cleanly into “data” vs. “business.” As tools automate more of the technical work, what’s becoming scarce is people who can responsibly translate between analysis and decision-making.

The real bottleneck often shows up after results are produced: how findings are interpreted, how confident conclusions sound, what decisions they’re allowed to inform, and how uncertainty is handled.

The most future-proof analysts I’ve seen understand both:

* what the data supports — and what it doesn’t
* the context in which interpretations become consequential

In my experience what sets a good analyst apart from a decent one being able to explain technical solutions to non technical people, and apply business solutions in a way which is complimentary to the technology at hand.

To elaborate if the business says we need A to do B, actually might actually need C to understand what A is. The best analysts will know their domain so well they will already have data models prepared to answer most businesses questions in advance.

In many DS roles, the value comes from problem framing, assumptions, and interpretation, not elegant abstractions. That said, hiring is often filtered through coding screens, and that is the frustrating part. Clean, readable, reliable code is usually enough, not algorithm wizardry. If your code is slowing you down or hurting interviews, it is worth investing in fundamentals like structure, testing, and data handling patterns.

The solution here, and is painful one, is to begin defining and involving stakeholders their most basic and important needs. Once that’s defined and agreed on, whatever is needed to solve for that will follow through. 

We don’t need to start from scratch everything all at once. But we do need to step back and ensure that what we’re saying it is, it really is. This is the result of coordinated effort to reach consensus and clarity about the operations that power whatever goal is pursued. 

I found myself in similar shoes in a project some time ago, I kept calling user session this, user session that, but once I stopped to think what really is a session and how it’s defined in that context, I had a hard time doing it.

I came in thinking that I wanted to predict outcomes but after some time, I realized that messy data is owned by no one. 

It’s very unlike for a person/team to own the semantics that power the understanding of the people in business and technical terms. 

An increase in sales means nothing if no one can be certain how sales should/is defined. Trust quickly erodes when the numbers can’t be trusted because the product was build on top of messy data.

They then describe the animal based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other.

Descriptive analytics is like each visualization being a blind man describing one part of the body of a large elephant.

Once I started deliberately separating:

analytics felt much more grounded and useful. Treating interpretation as its own step, not just an afterthought, is what really made things click for me.",3

2. Figure out what “good” performance is for that metric. 

3. Make sure your data collection is accurate. 

4. If your metric is a rate or percentage, make sure your denominator is correct. For example, if it’s conversions, is that per visit or per visitor? Is it all visits or visitors, or just the ones who do a specific action (log in or search or something else).

1q7c8z2,2,Analytics without decision power is just expensive reporting.,407
1q7c8z2,3,"This is way more common than people admit. Analytics becomes a translation layer between leadership decisions and justification. The work feels real because its busy. But nothing changes because nothing was ever allowed to change. The tell is when every meeting ends with lets keep an eye on it. That usually means no decision owner. 

When analytics works its usually boring. One metric, one owner, one lever. Ive watched teams chase new stacks hoping it fixes the problem. Sometimes it helps a bit. Domo comes up a lot. Same with power bi. But without decision ownership its just nicer looking theater",128
1q7c8z2,4,"Sort of correct. I was the dashboard user and ended up in analytics because the dashboards sucked.

The problem is the data is useful. Users will take the shitty tableau dashboard, make a crosstab view, download it and then do the real insights on their machine in Excel. 

That’s why it’s important to ask what they actually want and need. Sometimes it’s not insights, it’s just historical data. Other times it is insights, and if you know what they’re looking for you can white glove the user experience.",89
1q7c8z2,5,"Not trying to tout my own job, but product analytics typically pays more because our job is to take those metrics/data/dashboard in order to facilitate our own recommendation to make given decisions and drive the strategy with that.

When I was in sales analytics, I was what I call a SQL monkey or data ATM, you come to me, I give you something you want, etc i was an intermediary and all I did was provide visibility the way the stakeholder wanted. But now it’s I provide visibility I want and tell them how that should change their decision making. 

I think anyone in analytics role can try to be more of that person, it requires you to understand more than the numbers though, have to understand what the stakeholders know and what processes change and how based on the numbers",35
1q7c8z2,6,"Pretty much. Case in point: a VP asked me last year to ""do some analytics"" to come up with a data story that justified the decisions they had already made over the previous year. 

We are a joke to these people. They do nothing with the data but god save us all from their tantrums if something in a dashboard is wrong.",26
1q7c8z2,7,"I think this is generally true of monitoring tasks, like dashboards.

I think the true power of analysis is in paying attention and caring about a topic.

If the extent of your reporting is just ""This up that down"" then yeah, that's pretty worthless. But if you know why, and also how that is related to previous and future decisions then that's valuable because it means you're learning new best practices.",15
1q7c8z2,8,"Shhhh! You're not supposed to say that.

But yes, you're absolutely right. This is what the vast majority of exec teams don't understand how to leverage properly. If you have no culture around data integrity and data literacy, it doesn't matter how much you throw at the Office package, or Tableau or <fill in your favourite>, it will all be wasted.

And of course accountability also becomes so easy to skirt because you never bothered to define your organisation and its potential is real terms. I've sat in plenty of business review and board meetings as an external consultant and see it more often than not.",31
1q7c8z2,9,"I feel super fortunate to be in an analytics organization that is not like this. Our dashboards are genuinely used to monitor the business and take action when we see something. Our analysis outcomes drive decisions and we get to see meaningful impact on KPIs and outcomes because of the work we do. 

Our partners in products and operations trust us and rely on the data we provide to make decisions and justify them. But we also have a lot of latitude to drive analytics projects independently and champion the outcomes of those to drive change in the organization.

I don't take this for granted and definitely recognize this is probably a minority of analytics jobs, but they are out there.",11
1q7c8z2,10,"Analytics is doing a bunch of stuff to get people to look at data. If you can capture the attention of your team, you've succeeded. The effects don't have to be as obvious as ""We analyzed this data and are taking action X,Y,Z""

It could be as simple as ""we've all looked at clean data and know exactly how each campaign or product category performs relative to each other because its been visualized and we've all looked at the same report"".

And that can lead to more advanced reporting like predictive or prescriptive analytics.

And yet, a lot of companies get it wrong. It requires buy-in and culture. Not the easiest.",17

What tends to matter more day to day is intent and context. What problem someone is trying to solve and where they are in that moment usually beats age or job title.

Based on what you listed, you have the required technical skillset and are probably more qualified than most of the applicants that I see.

While other companies are not as fluent in data literacy and post a data analyst job but only require simple analysis using basic Excel.  It all depends on the job.  From my experience, even the companies that utilize Python, SQL, etc., still have stakeholders that will ask to provide an excel data export option in the dashboards so it would be a good idea to learn Excel.  I have no doubt with your skillset that you should pick it up quite easily.  Good luck!",8
1q77rzw,3,"I think you can pick it up on the job honestly.

I think most people use it for more granular data exploration and visuals from csv files you export from things like tableau.",4
1q77rzw,4,"If your data set is small and clean, and you only need to do something simple, then Excel works. For example I’m working on a project where the output is a few thousand rows and maybe 10 columns that don’t need any cleaning or transforming (that was handled Big Query via SQL). I just need to do some basic calculations which I can do in a pivot table, and then some basic line graphs. Also the team who needs this output needs it in Excel because they are plugging in some other data and then applying the percentages that i calculated in Excel. So I’m basically creating a workbook for them.

Most of what I learned about Excel I learned on the job. And then I learned the rest of what I know when creating my own interactive personal budget spreadsheet and some fitness tracker spreadsheets. Basically searching Google for “how to do xyz in Excel” and finding a tutorial.",4
1q77rzw,5,"Can you do a basic vlookup? Sumifs? Pivot Table? Index/Match?

You can handle most excel work if you can do this.",3
1q77rzw,6,"As someone from a similar DS background who now mainly falls into excel work, the problem you will run into is that the majority of the business world (Think 95%) has absolutely no knowledge or ability to use the tools listed. And I'm including Tableau. Most will ask for a payload in excel, make changes to excel and be able to make PPTs that use excel graph. You'd be surprised how much manual manipulation people  will do to the numbers. ""Oh this isn't correct because X or Y isn't labeled correctly"" Or we need to make adjustments this quarter  due to blah blah blah.

All this being said, Excel should be core to any Data Analyts stack. Framed with your question in mind, Excel will either be at the front or the end of you stack. Some small companies input data manually into excel, and a large majority willl still ingest or read data with excel. 

Make sure you learn it and learn it well.",2
1q77rzw,7,"You’re not wrong that Python and SQL can do way more than Excel, but Excel sticks around because it’s fast, accessible, and what a lot of business users live in all day. In real jobs, Excel usually shows up at the edges of your workflow for quick ad hoc analysis, sanity checks, sharing files with non technical teams, or responding to last minute questions without spinning up code. To be job ready, focus on formulas like XLOOKUP, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, IF, pivot tables, basic charts, and Power Query for light data cleaning. Think of Excel less as a replacement for your stack and more as a universal interface that lets you meet stakeholders where they already are.",2
1q77rzw,8,"I would highly recommend Power Query. It makes small scale ingestion and transformations stupid easy and it's easy to learn. With it's joins, you can eliminate a lot of basic v/xlookups which will help the file run faster. 

With a little bit of VBA, you can use a connection string to load data to SQL after the ET. 

I've upgraded many of our processes to python and I love python, but if I'm doing a quick ad hoc analyses or investigation that isn't too large, power Query is normally my go to. 

Python/SQL/Tableau are great, but knowing power Query in addition to pivots and lookups, you'll be a cut above most moderate Excel users which is useful in a world where most people just use excel.",2
1q77rzw,9,"You should learn Excel because it's ubiquitous. If nothing else, learning it will let you understand cases where someone at work hands you an Excel file full of their custom calculations and asks you to reproduce it in a proper analytics platform. If nothing else, learning Power Query is one step towards learning Power BI, and another dashboarding tool in your skillset alongside Tableau.

Based on your listed expertise, I don't think you'll have a hard time picking it up.",1
1q77rzw,10,"Excel fits as the fast, messy middle where stakeholders live, so learning pivot tables, XLOOKUP, Power Query, basic charts, and how to sanity check and explain numbers quickly will make you far more hireable than being technically perfect but slow to answer simple business questions.",1

1q6xv3p,2,"Sounds awful. We use github, dbt, airflow, fivetran and Snowflake. We have a very mature CI/CD process, and we require every analyst to contribute to the project. 

We have a 4 layered system, and everyone gets their own dev environment that is a direct copy of prod. We use a variety of dbt dependencies to make our lives easier (expectations, utils, etc). We require every new model to have a yml file, and we have a strict formatting structure when it comes to writing queries.

This keeps our 2k+ model project clean, but we do suck at documentation. It could be better. But I can teach any new person our model and have them fully up-to-speed in 3-6 months depending on level.",7
1q6xv3p,3,"I think you might need to define what you are trying to assign a lifecycle to. Data products is a big broad term. Analytical modeling, reports, measurement itself…


I treat the analytics software in our dept as software (SDLC). I handle reports with semantic versioning (x.y.z, first prod version is 1.0.0). I presently work with another dept on modeling so I just use their standards (they are a full BI team).


So, basically the processes we use depend on the specific part of analytics we are working on.",1

1q661xf,3,IN Cases like that wouldn't it make sense to come up with a standard color scheme that works for the so called manager,11
1q661xf,4,"This shows up a lot when teams lose clarity on who the work is actually for. The pattern behind the obsession with surface level details is often a lack of confidence in the underlying insight, so discussion drifts toward things that feel controllable. Color and layout matter, but only insofar as they support a decision. When they become the work, it’s usually a signal that outcomes and client questions aren’t clearly defined. Healthy analytics teams anchor debates in “what decision does this enable” and “what would change if this looked different.” Without that, you end up optimizing aesthetics while value delivery stalls.",8
1q661xf,5,"Experienced this quite a bit. Seems to develop with tenure, happens when they have nothing else to contribute except for this kind of gatekeeping.

Maybe it’s because I’m a jaded senior, but in real life none of that shit matters. Yes colour palettes play an important role, but if you can’t articulate why in less than a semester of classes and without speaking props, no one will care or remember.

Life is pragmatic. If the colour choices intuitively convey something  profound, I shouldn’t need a PowerPoint deck to explain what that is — it should be obvious else I failed.",7
1q661xf,6,"So frustrating. Dealt with a few analysts and clients who were like this, but never my own manager.",2
1q661xf,7,"That sounds exhausting, honestly. When process theater and endless bikeshedding replace actually delivering value, it drains the life out of a team fast. Plenty of analytics orgs are not like that at all, and if the work has turned into performative “visual philosophy” instead of helping clients make decisions, wanting out is a very sane reaction.",2
1q661xf,8,"Yeah, color use and aesthetics are potentially important, but that’s a one-time discussion to set company standards when building client-wide templates with maybe 10-minute follow-ups if you have questions about incorporating a particular client’s color scheme. That’s it.",2
1q661xf,9,"I have noticed that there are bosses like these who worry about color schemes (the only one I care about is if people who are color blind can see the differences in color of each thing) are usually bosses who couldn’t even select star from a table. I work with them as a peer and also find them frustrating on behalf of their staff, especially when those folks are also unkind to their employees.",2

1q61v7y,2,"I’d focus on getting at least a 3.0 gpa. You need it to get into a decent masters program. Now as far as is it worth it. To me yes, especially if it’s funded.",6
1q61v7y,3,"A 1 year MSBA can rest your academic record and give you practical experience, but only if you commit fully, otherwise it is just more time and money.",3
1q61v7y,4,Drop GPA from resume and really skill up. But I’d second finding a way to push for 3.0 and definitely don’t both with Masters,2
1q61v7y,5,"Honestly a one year masters can help, but only if you actually use it to change your situation and not just as a GPA bandaid. Employers care way more about skills, projects, and experience than whether your GPA went from 2.7 to 3.5, especially in analytics and econ adjacent roles. If you do the masters, treat it like a reset where you aggressively build projects, network, and land internships or part time work while you’re in it. Otherwise you might end up in the same spot a year later, just with more debt and a nicer transcript.",2
1q61v7y,6,"Honest question: if you have a 2.7 in Econ and Statistics, what makes you think doing an MSBA will improve your gpa? 

I thought graduate courses took more work, not less?",1
1q61v7y,7,"Don't sweat it.  There are far more C and D average students in the workforce than you can even imagine.  

Personally, I'd focus your efforts on getting a job, any ol' job, and consider the Master's degree later on once you're settled in your career and looking to advance beyond an IC role or into something more technical.

I graduated with a low B-average, but my last two years (post transfer) took a hit--more like a high C-average like you--because I was just...overwhelmed by school and life at 22-23.  I thought this was going to be a death sentence to my career, but it ended up working out fine in the end.  I don't think any job, other than a handful early on, required my transcripts or GPA.  I'm just now (at 40) going back for a Master's degree in Information Systems because I'm looking for a new challenge.  I've already completed some MS coursework in the past with a 4.0 GPA, so I know now that my head's on straight.",1
